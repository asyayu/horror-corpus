Look at me, I'm not even awake.
Living here is time off.
Larry Vaughn says we'll pull a record
season. Ellen, we're collecting high
enough rentals to cover the mortgage
payments for all three of our beachfront
investments.
Uh...look, Ellie. Let's just ---.
Mornin' Hendricks. What's what?
First goddamn weekend of the summer...
great start!
No...take him back to the beach.
Maybe she washed in.
Christine what?
You picked her up on the ferry.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Sounds to me like maybe she ran out
on you.
We may know in a minute.
Jesus, Santos.
Polly, I want to know what water
recreation the Island fathers have
on for today.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'
signs?
Call me later in the afternoon,
Harry.
Let Polly do the printing.
Oh, brother! Gimme the keys, Lenny.
Are you asking me as the Mayor, or
as a Real Estate broker, or our of
friendly interest, or what, Larry?
So what you're suggesting is we lay out
a smorgasbord for the shark. All you can
eat for the price of a weekend on Amity
Island.
What else could do that?!
What is this?
You print whatever you want.
I... don't go around the water much.
If that's the test case for your
million-to-one shot, I'm glad I lost.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
Tell him I want him out of the ocean.
Michael! Come inside the house!
I told him not to go out until he
memorized the handbook, safety regulations
and ---.
What?
Did you say something?
How's the water?
Drowning.
MICHAEL -- ! EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER!! MICHAEL -- !
Larry and I have agreed to close
all beaches for a limited period
of time to give us a chance to
contact the Port Authority and
United States Coast Guard out on
Montaux.
We never agreed to that.
Listen, Larry, I'm going to talk
to her. This isn't a contest we
want everybody from Boston to
Quebec entering.
Larry, I'm responsible for the public safety around here....
But nobody sport-fishes for shark!
Looks more like the Harvard Lampoon.
Isn't there a limit to how many
men those boats'll carry?
No dynamite! Hand that stuff over
or you'll never leave port!
It belongs to whoever catches it.
You'll move this car to a parking
slot, mister, or it won't be here
when you get back.
It's always nice to meet an educated
man.
I don't have time to help you with
your homework.
One shark did all this?
You'll pardon me i f I don't help
you get your Ph.D. while my town here
degenerates into some high-class
ghost resort.
We've had two other attacks since
the Watkins thing, both fatal.
Could you kill it for us?
Then how do we begin to cooperate?
Let him.
Want to see?
Yours?
Is it the one?
The Institute of Sharks sent him
to lend a hand -- Matt Hooper.
-- the boy's mother.
He's a fish expert from the Oceanographic
Foundation.
Some field you picked.
He would have called his wife.
No point sending up a plane, huh?
I don't do so hot on boats.
Listen ---.
But you could protect the beach -- !
I mean, you have access to ---.
What do I do then? Pray for
lousy weather?
I told you not to wear that crackerjack
ring. It's too big -- you're
gonna catch it on something and
lose a finger.
More in the spirit of the public
interest.
Don't sleep with that on, son.
You'll cut something in the night.
In case you haven't caught the
island gossip, I never take baths
-- just showers.
Yeah. Listen. I'm no crack meteorologist,
but I think we're in store
for some surf.
No. Here, wait.
I could throw your ass in jail for
that.
Once hooked, what then?
Now let's wait a minute. You have
him hooked, right?
And you stick that -- cigarette
case to his neck?
Then you let it loose. You let
it go free.
Your little lab experiment has
seen three innocent people killed
over the past three days.
And your list makes me sick. You
carry it around with you like
you're keeping score.
Oh, Christ. Whose side are you on?
You told me you'd help us get rid
of it.
I don't give a crap about your
worldwide conquest. What about
right here? This town is going
under today! Where's your humanity?
You could kill this thing for us,
flatten its ass and ---.
If you stick that wet spot under
the black light at the Coney
Island Aquarium, they'll let you
in for nothing.
Mr. Hooper figured its size from
this -- it's over a ton. It's
also over ---.
What should we do about this white?
Maybe we can make it up in August.
We have to give this a coupla weeks.
Don't let him out of your sight.
Not for a second. Stay at a discreet
distance -- and dammit,
Lenny, no shark talk! The way
sound carries over water, you're
a dead giveaway.
Local hire...I don't know. I want
to hear from you, Len.
I know it's late, Mr. Quint.
I would have called you ---.
I'm Chief Brody, Mr. Quint --.
Listen ---.
Got Ben Gardner this time.
I need to talk to you, Quint ---.
We can't have this damn thing
sneaking in ---.
Ever caught one?
Now you're asking ten thousand
dollars, but look ---.
How's four hundred a day, Quint?
How much do you want?
I came on my own, Quint.
See, if we could make a deal tonight --.
Quint, you know they'll never ---.
Seventy-five for who?
I have to tell them something
reasonable ---.
Any luck?
How can you be sure?
Are you feeling okay?
Vaughn's going to want a statement.
What about taking precautions?
And you're sure it's ---
Makes sort of a long black
curtain.
But it doesn't always work.
That, and Tang.
No, I'll be sticking to business
today. As you see, we have spotters
up and down the beach, and out there's
the Coast Guard, State Police, County
Police -- everyone's cooperating
on this ---.
It never hurts to play it safe.
Hey Mikey -- !
You're not going to the ocean
with that, are you son?
Do me this favor just once. Use
the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
Everybody out! Out of the water,
please -- leave the water, please ---.
No whistles! No whistles!
Anywhere we can see it's dead.
Call me. Soon as you have some news.
I'll go.
I really want to go, Mr. Quint.
I'll get a pro to come along.
You still think it's all the way
out here?
You got it?
He's nearly up ---.
He's hurt.....
I don't understand though...How you
expect to ---.
Where'd it go?
Why don't we go in? Have a crack
tomorrow....?
What -- What the hell --- ?
Are we leaking?
Can't I bail or something?
No -- still there!
Please, Matt, don't get him sore.
He's loony enough.
Put all that stuff away before he
finds out.
Shark! Starboard! It's under
you -- !
We can't do it ourselves....
He chewed through this, he cracked
your boat -- radio in for help ---.
I mean it! Send out an S.O.S.!
I'll do it.
This won't kill it!
I can't stand here doing nothing!
What about us?
Where'd he go?
Have you ever had one do this?
There -- !
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us...I don't believe
it.
Maybe we killed it?
Live and learn.
Quint... Quint... is he dead?

‘Cause he know he’s got you
          wrapped around his little paw.
Yeah.
Check... Check....
I’m not gonna have one the whole
weekend.
I’m nervous.
Yeah? How do you know?
Good answer.
Do they know I’m black?
Seems like you might give them a
heads up.
You said, I’m the first black guy
          you’d ever dated.
So this is uncharted territory for
          them.
Bye.
How do they even let you in a
hospital?
Yeah. You?
How long has it been?
Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I’m a
          grown man. If a man says he wants
          a cigarette, a man should be able
          too- -
Okay, so that’s like a dollar. You
          basically just throwin’ dollars
          out the window.
I didn’t buy them. Rod... Shit.
I almost forgot Rod.
Hey. You at work?
Look, man, real quick. You good to
          watch Sid this weekend right?
You’re right. My bad.
She’s good--.
Okay, get your own girl.
No! What the fuck is wrong with
you?
You need help.
I’ll see what I can do. Oh, and
          I’ll kick you some cash for
          watching Sid.
Thanks, man.
Last one!
You okay?
Yeah. That scared the shit out of
me.
Stay here.
I don’t know... See if it’s okay?
Maybe it’s gone--.
Right. That makes sense.
Yeah.
Oh... yeah.
I mean, I don’t have a driver’s
          license, I have a state I.D.
Baby. It’s okay--.
That was some ride or die shit,
          baby. I like that.
Hey! What’s up?
Hi.
Good to finally meet you...
Sure.
Alright.
I’ve heard so much about you guys.
I’m fine with the embarrassing by
          the way; go ahead.
Wow.
I grew up in a one bedroom, so for
me, this is ridiculous.
It came out of nowhere.
Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.
I cannot believe they kept it the
          same.
They’re great.
No, they’re totally sweet.
What?! Is this you?
I didn’t know you acted.
Wait, what about the tour?
We just got here. I don’t wanna be
          disrespectful...
I’m serious. Later.
I’ve heard stories.
Oh, cool.
I hear that happens a lot.
--Owens won in front of Hitler.
Not really. That one always just
          stood out in my mind.
Yeah, tough break for your father
though.
She’s a Therapist right?
Like mother like daughter.
And you’re a surgeon?
That view.
Hi.
Yeah?
I wasn’t gonna go there.
Hey. People need work.
My Dad was never really in the
          picture. My mom passed away when I
          was 11; She was hit by a car.
Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my
          cousins. We didn’t have a lot of
          money or anything, but she’s a
          good person; kept me off the
          streets. She gave me my first
          camera.
4 months? 5 months.
5? She’s right; I’m wrong.
I mean, we’ve been trying to take
          it slow but...
At the blood drive.
No. I’m quitting.
How?
Oh.
 Wow. I don’t... Thank you. Um, I
          don’t know.
The get-together?
I must have forgot.
Sounds fun.
No, no... These are good. I wanna
hear this.
Whoa, what?
Ahhhh! You bit him?
Damn. That’s badass, Bae.
Ah, Orioles. My mom was from
          Baltimore so--.
You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too
          brutal for me. I’m a lover, not a
          fighter.
Not really. I did take Judo for
          after-school in 1st grade.
Cool... Thanks?
I’ve got a rule. I don’t play-
          fight with drunk dudes.
Yeah. Nerves got me I guess.
I still don’t know if this is
right for me.
I’m good. The dude was running out
          there. Scared me.
Nah, I’m good. It’ll keep me up.
Yeah.
It’s perfect, thanks.
Yep.
So, how does this work? Are you
          going to swing a pocket watch in
          front of my face?
Heightened suggestibility. Okay,
          where do we start?
Yeah, my memory sucks.
I guess if it makes me quit...
          Wait... Has it started--?
I was home. I was watching TV.
Okay... Yeah, I found it.
I knew it. She was never late
          after work. When she didn’t come
          home, I just knew something was
          wrong.
I found it.
Nothing.
I just sat there. Watching TV.
No.
I don’t know. I thought if I did,
          it would make it real.
I found it.
--Found it.
I don't want to.
Wait--.
No! NO!!! I’m done! Bring me back!
Please!!!!
Mrs. Armitage!!
Something’s down here...
Bring me back. Bring me back.
          Bring me back. Bring me back...
 Bring me back. Bring me back.
          Bring me back.
No!
Damn.
What’s up?
They working you good out here,
huh?
Ha!
Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I
          never really got to meet you
          actually, up close. I’m Chris.
Yeah. That’s one way to put it.
          So, where you from originally?
Rose? Yeah, she is...
Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was
          pretty drunk.
I don’t remember much.
Hypnosis? No, I didn’t...
There’s another bird...
Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I
          think your mom hypnotised me last
          night.
I think I snuck out for a smoke,
          and she caught me and offered? I
          don’t know. I must have agreed to
          it ‘cause the thing just made me
          nauseous.
No, not good. I can barely
          remember any of it even happening;
          I don’t like that. Plus I had
          these fucked up dreams.
What did?
And, what’s the deal with the
help?
That, but also the lawn-mower guy
          creepin’ me the fuck out too.
It’s not what he says, it’s how he
          says it. You know?
Thanks. You too.
Once, actually; a few years ago. I
          wasn’t very good.
Oh? No kidding.
Me? I could barely hit the thing.
It’d be kind of a waste of time
          travel though.
Wow. Um..
Oh, will you now?
Right. I mean--.
I’m sorry. I’m going to get
          another drink.
It’s good to see another brother
around here.
Who do you know?
Chris. Rose’s boyfriend.
Sure.
What? Oh, I forgot.
Who?
I guess people only see what’s in
          front of them.
I mean...
Chris--.
Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson
          Galleries?
How do you do it?
Thank you. Yeah, I just like
          finding the beauty in abandoned
          things.
Damn.
Shit ain’t fair, man.
Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you.
Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That
          would be a game changer.
Not my game, what can I say.
Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin’
smack huh?
Boom!
Hold up. Here.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
The housekeeper unplugged my
          phone.
I’m trying to check in with Rod,
          and I got no juice.
Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she
          doesn’t like the fact that I’m
          with you.
What? It’s a thing.
Forget it. Nevermind.
You’re right. I’m being paranoid.
          I just need a minute and I’ll be
          down.
Bruh. What’s up?
Yeah...
They just got me over here meeting
          all the family friends. It’s like
          they never met a black dude that
          doesn’t work for them or some
          shit.
Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised
          last night...
Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose’s mom
          is a hypnotherapist--.
Right.
 Yeah, I’m like 99% sure they’re
          not a kinky sex family, but--.
And thanks for that image, right
there.
It’s the black people out here
          that are the weirdest. The help.
          It’s like they’re possessed or...
Ha ha--.
What’s fucked up is: You’re the
          first line of defense against
          terrorism.
Oh, and the one other black guest
          is like the whitest-most dude at
          the party.
I mean Rod, if you could see what
          this dude is wearing.
Aiight. I’ll try.
Thanks Rod, bye.
Hi.
Oh, no. It’s cool. I was just
confused.
Yeah, I--.
Really, it’s okay. I didn’t mean
          to rat you out.
...get you in trouble.
Too many names to remember but...
Yeah, I don’t know, man.
That’s actually a great question.
          Logan! They were asking me about
          the African American experience.
          Maybe you could take this one.
Shit.
Hey, man, I’m sorry, I--.
Yeah. Why did he come at me like
that?
No, I’m sorry about the flash. I
didn’t know.
Yeah, you too.
My cousin is epileptic. That
          wasn’t a seizure.
Also, this is gonna sound weird,
          but when he got up in my face like
          that, I got the feeling like I
          knew that guy.
Let’s go back home tonight.
I’m just... Something doesn’t feel
right.
No. With this whole situation! I
          just... I can’t explain but I need
          you to trust me. Let’s just go. It
          doesn’t even have to be a big
          deal.
Baby, I--.
Late?
Oh.
I don’t know what to say.
I told you about the night my mom
          died. How I didn’t call 911;
          didn’t go out looking for her.
One hour went by, then two,
          three... I just sat there... I
          just watched TV.
I found out later she had survived
          the initial hit.
She laid there bleeding by the
          side of the road all night, cold
          and alone. And that’s how she died
          in the early morning... Cold and
          alone. And I was watching TV.
There was time. If someone was
          looking for her, there was time.
          But no one was looking.
Yeah... yeah. So, I’m not gonna
          leave here without you. I‘m not
          going to abandon you. Never.
Yeah?
I love you.
That was fast.
Dre?
Veronica from...
Yeah. That is him. But...
This is so fuckin’ crazy. He’s
          different now.
Different. Slower... I mean he was
          street; now he’s all like...
          white- seeming. Oh, plus he’s gay!
I’m telling you: He’s gay, I met
          his man. He’s--.
Um... Looking for my camera.
Where are the keys..? I gotta put
          our bags in the trunk.
Nah, I’ll do it.
Nothing.
I’m going to the car; see if we
          left the keys in there.
I’m good.
Yeah.
No. Well, yeah... Um.
What?
Right now, it’s finding the keys.
Rose...
Rose, what is this shit?!
--Rose.--
I was raised Episcopalian.
 --I don’t know what you’re saying!
Rose! The keys!!!
What the fuck?
Rose!!!
Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit,
shit...
Rose!!!!
No!! Help!!! Help!!!!! Help!!!!!!
Hey. Hey!!!! Rose!!!!
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh
          shit. The fuck?!?!! Y’all are
          psycho!? Is that it? Let me out of
          this chair.
People know I’m here. I told a
          bunch of people where I was going!
          You don’t know me!!! You don’t
          know me!!!! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!!!
Is this the only song you got?
Okay. Okay! What do you want? You
          tryin’ to break me? I won’t say
          shit!! I’ll just... I’ll do what
          you say, just answer me!
No-.
I need water.
I need to get outta here.
Where’s Rose?
Is this some kind of a game to
you?
Who the fuck are you people?
You hypnotize me? Break my will..?
          Make me a slave like the others?
          This is some crazy racist shit.
Wait, what?
For what?
What’s the procedure?
What the fuck?
No.
And my brain?
...The Sunken Place.
Me... You will be me.
Why black people?
That’s crazy.
You’re not going to get away with
this.
No, No--.
Shhhh.
Ahhhh!
No... no... Don’t do it... Just
          get the fuck gotta here... Just
          go! Just... Fuck!
Ahhhhhhhh!!
Wait.
Look in the basement!
...I don’t remember...
I don’t remember.
I don’t remember.
Rod.
Rod.
I’m good, man. I stopped it. You
          know? I stopped it.
(laughing).
(whispering).
(whispering).
(hazy).
(passive aggressive).
(Seeing Rod’s point).
(dry).
(amused).
(defeated).
(to himself).Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly
like normal people?
Please, your parents can't stand
me.
We could have taken them on a
cruise.
What's that supposed to mean?
It won't be in a shitty trailer
home-that's for sure.
Excuse me sir, do you have a phone
I can use? I can't get a signal
around here and...
This is why I don't go on vacation.
They're lost without me.
Who me? No way. I'm in
telecommunications.
Everybody's gotta have a cell
phone...
No kidding...
As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns--.
Let me pay, Bob.
That's not what I meant...
Honey!? We're leaving...
Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.
Honey? What are you doing?!
I tried for an hour but I couldn't
get it cold in here.
Well, at least we can breathe now.
How do you know all this stuff?
Fuck her!
Fuck him too. You want one?
Yeah right, if you start smoking
your sister would cut my nuts off.
Hey, I like seeing your parents...
...in pictures!
What the hell happened?! Where's
Catherine?
I knew this wasn't gonna be safe
for the baby.
Are you all right?
Your father wanted to see the
desert...
I hope he's enjoying himself.
So what's the damage, General?
Can we fix it?
I already tried. I'm not getting a
signal.
What are we going to do?
Walk?! But we're miles from ANYWHERE--.
Oh no! No thanks buddy...
I'll keep walking north. This
road's gotta lead somewhere.
What the fuck are you doing? Don't
point that thing at me.
Who else would it be?!
Hey girls!
Look what I found.
With all of this, we can find a way to fix the car, right Bobby?
I found this really huge crater at
the end of the road! I've never
seen anything like it! People must
use it as a dump site. It was full
of all this garbage...
Look at this, it's brand new!
No. The road just stops there. I
hope your dad has better luck.
Is there anything to eat? I'm
starving.
You want us to sleep on the floor?!
What?
What?
Listen... I'm sure your dad will be
back soon. He's "Big Bob". It's
gonna take more than a few snakes
in the dark to stop him, right?
If he's not back by midnight, we'll
go get him. Deal?
Ow, Ow... Yeah right there.
Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed
New Mexico on foot.
Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!
Oh, so you want to play?
I love you too...
Damanit! What is it now?
Beauty what?
Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check
it out together. Lynn, stay right
here.
Brenda, stay with Catherine!
Take your mother away from here!
Where are you going? Bobby?
Come back here, Bobby!
No... No...
Not yet.
Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in
the kitchen.
Yes..
Do you need anything?
There's one here. Nice and warm.
DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?
You want to die, too?
Look! Look at what they did to your
mother. Look at what they did to
your sister.
You're not a fucking child,
alright? Think before you do
something stupid. You won't make it
three feet! We need a plan, OK? We
need to think...
STOP IT! SHUT UP! JUST SHUT YOUR
FUCKING MOUTH!
Get ready Bobby..
Beast!
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS TO US?!
ANSWER ME! WHY US?!
How much ammo do you have left?
No, you stay here with your sister
and stay by the radio. Somebody's
bound to hear us.
The sun'll be up soon. One of them
is hurt, I'm going to follow his
trail through the hills.
No. You keep it in case they come
back.
Don't worry about me, I'll take
Beast.
Yes?
I'm going to find our baby my
love...I promise.
I told you to stop smoking.
Bobby? Bobby? You read me?
I followed the blood, I'm in front
of a mine!
I'm not sure if I'll get a signal
from inside. If you don't hear from
me in a half an hour, you're on
your own.
You ready big guy? I hope you're
not afraid of the dark.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Just stay calm, boy...
Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug... I
can't believe it! I found a street
and some houses. Maybe somebody
does live here...
Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby?
Find her, Beast, find Catherine...
You wait here Beast! Come on,
sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find
Catherine...
Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!
I'll be back...
Where's my baby! Where's
Catherine?!
What did you do with her?
What signs?!
What the hell are you saying?!
I don't know what you're talking
about. All I want is my daughter.
Please...
What do you want? Money? I can give
you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?
Where are the others? Where is my
baby?
What? What's so funny?
Please, I'm begging you... Don't
kill me...
Catherine?!
CATHERINE!
Catherine!
My baby... My little princess... It's
me, it's daddy...

Poor little son of a bitch. You're
starting to lose it, aren't you?
... Cheating bastard ....
We got any more of those electronic
chess things down in supply?
What for?
It's against regulations to go up
this time of year!
So, I don't want to end up crawling
around with them when we go down.
What are you talking?! He's had
two months training in those choppers!
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year ....
Anybody in there?!
Come to help you!!
Give me a hand.
Hey, Sweden! .. You okay?
Sweden!?
Come on, Copper.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Norwegian of the !1onth, Doc.
Harmless.
Holy shit....
Portable video unit.
Anything?
What are you doing?
It's getting late. Hurry it.
I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Copper, come here!!
Careful. It's about to go.
Little ice core drilling...some
seismology ... glaciology ... same old shit we do.
Just listen.
Decanite? .. Thermite charges?...
What in...
Clark.
Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of it.
I'm going to shoot.
Clark? Where are you? Clark!
Childs, you got that torch? You
get your ass in here!!
Torch it over there!
Screw the doas!! Torch it!!
Don't let up, Childs!
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
So what do you make of it?
No chance it could have been some
new kind of test craft?
Look, I'm just guessing...
...So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him
back. He gets thawed out, wakes
up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl ...
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs.
Light it up.
Fuck history. At least we're going
to live to be an old bunch of assholes.
I ain't going anywhere in
anything over forty knots, Garry ....
All set.
To us.
Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm just a beginner.
Aw shit.
Sorry, hon.
Never any damn ice around here...
Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got ice... They got ice coming out of their ears.
What's ....
He smashed one of the choppers up good. Childs, go check the other one and the tractor.
Too damn dangerous.
No, wait a minute.
The fuse box.
Look, Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
If you're right we've all got to
stick together.
And mainly ours.
Leave a bit of an opening so he can
see out.
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
They couldn't have gotten that far
in this weather.
I am going after them.
Get these things out of supply
and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Palmer, how long would it take
you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Then get a move on. Childs, come
with me.
That's good enough.
Let's load 'em.
Haybe dinner.
I know.
Probably the next meal.
Where these tracks headed?
Let's move.
Turn back if you want.
Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?
Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't let up until he's ash.
Childs!!
Stay back!!
How the fuck do I know?!
Torch them!!
He's gone already! Do it!
Well, you can believe it now.
Nauls found this yesterday. It's ripped just like the clothing on
the Norwegian we brought back. The same thing was happening to Bennings' clothes when it got to him. Seems these Things don't imitate clothes. Just flesh and bone.
Size large.
What do you wear, Clark?
So do I. So do most of us.
Doubt if it got to more than one
or two of us. But it got to someone.
Somebody in this room ain't what he appears to be.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces
of it during the fight.
Nas it broken into?
Well, who's got access to it?
Would that test have worked?
Who else could have used that
key?
Could anyone have gotten it from
you?
Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it away.
Maybe it should be someone a bit
more even-tempered, Childs.
... Any objections?
...From what we know this Thing
likes to go one on one. So we stick together as much as possible. In two's and three's.
We got morphine, don't we?

Well, we keep them loaded. Stash them here in the rec room and watch
'em twenty-four hours.
Right. Half of us awake at all
times.
Can you think of any other tests?
Also... When this Thing turns... it turns slowly at first. I think we can handle it in that state. But
if it ever got to full power... from what I saw of that Norwegian camp ...well, I just don't know... It would probably take it an hour or more to get like that. So no matter what anybody's doing, we all return to this room every twenty minutes. Anybody gone longer than that... anybody trying to leave... we kill
'em.
Look for shoes, too. And burned
cloth.
Just keep looking.
How's it going?
Gotchya.
Move it, Palmer.
Start taking apart those snowmobiles next, huh?
What's happened!?
Yeah!
Well, let's get down there.
What?
Oh, shit!
Well, hang on!
Hho... Who is that?
Sanchez..? Hey, who....
We going to make it?
Screw the flaihlights. Where the
hell were you?
Anybody see Fuchs ... or hear him? ... Huh?
That storm's going to start ripping
any minute -- so we don't have much time.
We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes ...Nauls, you and Childs and I'll
check the outside shacks ....
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside ....
Cut the bullshit ... Okay, Sanchez, you
come with us. Norris ... you stay here ...
Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.
We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.
And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close.
Let's move.
Hey, Blair!!
Has Fuchs been out here?
Have you come across Fuchs?
We'll see....
Couldn't be possible. Must have weighed a ton and a half ....
Open up!
... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's
me, MacReady...
... Come on, damn it ... The towline
snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here ...
...Where is everybody!? I'm half
frostbit!
What's going on out there?
What are you doing?
Someone's trying to mark me, you
bastard ... trying to frame me.
What clothes?
Anyone messes with me -- the whole
camp goes.
Put those torches on the floor and back off.
...back way off.
... Where's the rest ...
So help me I mean it!!
Anybody touches me ... we go.
Go untie the Doc. Get him in here.
Bring the others, too ...
From now on no one gets out of my sight.
So you sweethearts had yourselves
a little trial. I just may have to kill you on general principle, Nauls.
...Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up ....
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs ...
And if anyone tries to wake me....
Get out of the way!!
A little test.
I'm sure a lot of you already
know.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
For your health.
Damn if I won't.
Then I'll have to kill you.
I mean it.
Tie up Clark, too.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself.
Bullets don't kill these Things.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We're going to draw a little bit of
everybody's blood.
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Now you.
Slide it back here.
Now step way back.
I guess you're okay.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Watch them.
Now I'll show you what I already know.
We'll see. Let's try Clark.
Palmer now.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry.
You were the only one who could have aotten to that blood plasma ...
...we'll do you last....
Blair....
Everything that's been missing.
Smart s.o.b. He put it together
piece by piece.
Anyplace but there.
But he ain't going to make it.
Forget about Childs. He's over.
It'll come. It needs us. We're
the only thing left to imitate...
Give me a hand.
You and Nauls got to block off
the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
I'm going to blow the generator
when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
We've got portable heaters -- we'll last longer.
...Hold it.
Sodium cyanide. ile place them between our cheeks and gums ... This Thing can't imitate anything that's dead.
If it gets a hold of you -- bite
down ... They're supposed to be fast and painless ... Now move.
Looks good.
What are they doing out there?!
Got to get to the generator.
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Little over two hours.
Then we go after him.
Wait ...
Okay, creep! Just you and me now!
Be on your toes! We're going to do a little remodeling!
Chime in if you know the words,
old boy.
You like whiskey? Come on, Join
me for a drink. Be good for you. Grow fangs.on your chest.
Damn it, ran out of gas.
Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... you better make your move... I mean, hell, I'm only one person...
I know you're bugged because we ruined your trip, right? Spiffy little toy you had there.
But your real hang· up is your looks ....
Atta boy. I know you're around.
Come on, sucker.
I think so.
Yeah. I got it.
Pretty mean frostbite.
Not the only one.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If we've got any surprises for
each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.

Hey‚ I think this is where we get off.
I... I sent 'em a check for the tune-up‚ but I'm just not paying for it.

Just now‚ I mean upstairs.

Scott‚ leave her alone will ya?
Scott‚ you knew not to play it‚ I mean... I mean you knew it was upsetting her. You just don't know when you're carrying something too far.
No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay. It's just that ever since we came up here‚ things have been a little too tense. All these crazy things going on. And look at that window - we're gonna have to pay for that window now.
I hope so.
What'ya say we stay up for a while and listen to the storm.
Stealing from the blind eh? It's for you.
I was going to give it to you before we left‚ but things got so hectic‚ this is the first chance I've had. Do you like it?

We've still got a few hours before morning.
I don't know.
No... no... no... 
Uh... Scott.
What is uh... what are we gonna do? 
You... can't bury Shelly. She's a friend of ours isn't she? 
-- Or if it's even still in tact.
I will. Do you have everything?

You'll get better - you'll see.

(Crying and holding her tightly).
(Crying and yelling to the cellar).
(In a whisper).
(He whispers).Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.
I will. Don't worry.
Fuck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
John Denver...
He died in a plane crash.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE!
We have to get out!
We have to get off this plane!
Now! NOW!!
I'm not joking! I'm not joking!
Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground...
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital.
I wish you were on the plane!
You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
No. I saw it. I saw it!
Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight...
I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before...
No!
Because... I... never thought it would really happen.
I don't.
Then maybe you should lay off the J.D.
Not here, not now. Not EVER!
Ms. Lewton...
I don't want to sound gay, or nothin', but... I miss you.
That's a plan.
What happened? Is Tod alright?
What... what happened?
Mr. Waggner...
He wouldn't do it!
He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself?
It's only the end of June.
Like, um... you're mad about something?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Why were you there last night?
Why were you there last night?
I'm... really sorry.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
This place?!
That... him?
That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're
not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Why..?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
What are all those tiny marks?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Design?
Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game?
I'm sorry we broke in.
Yeah, we did.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Remember the departure time?
Do you know when I was born?
Right. April 25th.
My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!?
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it.
But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still (beat).die; now, not later.
Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again.
Then there's no one left who can help me.
This'll be hard to believe.
Listen to me, we may all be in danger...
Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it.
That's Tod's seat...
The path of the explosion... That's Death's design.
Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.
I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer.
This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone.
And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Ms. Lewton!
Ms. Lewton!
Are they up there?
Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe?
Most kids do, I guess.
This won't be safe.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Why do you think I was hiding?
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
I already told you...
Yeah.
When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Carter, stop it, you fuckin' maniac!!
Let us out!
Billy, get out!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car!
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
After Billy... it's me. And then you.
Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.
Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.
I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!
I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine...
She's next.
Don't move!
You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
NO!
You know what to do.
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
You know what to do. I'll always be with you.
NO!
(beat).
(beat).
(beat).
(a whisper).
(beat).
(sighs).
(quietly).
(almost to himself).
(as if to Death).
(defiant).Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
Cattle ranch!
Right. Fire up all systems.
Where are we?
What the hell?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
What? Why?
Unknown! What do you mean?
Oh my God.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Hell, no! We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Look --.
No -- that's atmosphere. Cloud layer.
Just a second.
Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Atmospheric turbulence. Dust storm.
Locked.
Engines off.
Engine room, what happened?
Has the hull been breached?
How long to fix?
Well, get started.
Not much help.
Or something will be able to see us.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
How's it coming on the engines?
Yeah, okay.
Close...
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero. Dry as a bone.
Not a one. It's dead.
Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
Read you, Chaz.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you. I've got you on my board.
I agree. This is the single most important discovery in history.
What killed it?
He died.
Not they... he...
... There was only one skeleton.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
But why draw it on the wall?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Here comes the dust again.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
Well, there ought to be some way we can get through to them --.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Yes!
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Go ahead!
You mean... you've translated it?
Well come on, come on! What does it say?
The computer just translated the goddamn message. It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases. I'll just read it to you the way I got it: "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... " And that's all it could translate.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
We can't spare the personnel. We've got minimum takeoff capability right now. That's why Chaz left us on board.
Just can that crap! I'm in command here till Chaz returns! And nobody's leaving this ship!
How many?
Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there's been a new development --.
Oh no.
Right.
Here, Chaz.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
I understand why you did that.
I guess I had it coming. Let's call it settled.
Would somebody fill me in?
Look at that.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Seems to have stopped penetrating.
I think it's fizzled out.
My God, what about Broussard?
Did it get on him?
Look there, what's that stain on his lungs?
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Hey! what about the film?
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he? We can see what happened to him.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
What common objects?
Is that its mouth?
Ugh.
For Chrissake, open the main lock!
My God, it's lethal even when it's dead!
About four hours.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --.
Yeah?
Where did the parasites come from?
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
I think we better take another look at those heiroglyphs.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.
I'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity --.
What was that?
We made it! Damn, we made it!
With great pleasure.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Do you remember the pyramid?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
You like this shit?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
What Dell -- what?
That thing used him for an incubator!
But we can't kill it. If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We won't need it then.
But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
We have to avoid injuring it. What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Even simple.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust. Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Where's it coming from?
Okay.
Oh, hold it!
Yes!
Where are you?
We're coming!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Now what?
You win.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Now what?
Where does that go?
Are you crazy?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
There. That's where it's got to come out.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Uh-huh.
By eating our food supplies.
It was horrible -- horrible. Like a chicken.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.
Two down, four to go.
Nothing.
Don't count on it.
I think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
So the next step should be --.
This is all the same creature. We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases. Only four forms are shown. After that the pattern repeats.
... More spores coming.
How much oxygen did we lose?
I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. His body held it open.
No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
No such luck. I saw it running down one of the corridors.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed. And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Yeah... I forgot.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
It's not going to work.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Hey watch it!
So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Oh -- Jesus --.
I should hope so! And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Who gets the privilege?
Is it armed?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Kablooey.
Hello? Standard? Hunter?
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
What can I do?
Kitty go bye-bye.
What'll it be, Kitty? Here -- how about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it. This'll buy us an island on some nice planet.
Computer! I've turned all the cooling units back on! What's wrong?
Try a little of this, you fucking bastard.
... So it looks like I'll make it back to the Colonies on schedule after all. I should be to the frontier in another 250 years or so, and then with a little luck the network will pick me up. I'm not as rich as I was a couple days ago -- but I'm not exactly broke either. Incidentally, I did manage to salvage one souvenir out of this whole mess.
Poor Yorick here should go at least partway toward proving I'm not a crank. I wish it was him we'd met in the first place -- things might have turned out different.
This is Martin Roby, executive officer, last survivor of the commercial vessel SNARK, signing off. Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

Thanks, Kev.
Scotty McLeod! You throw like you
drive, son, too damn fast!
Look alive, fellas! Deano, watch
the squeeze!
Rory, what in God -- ?
Rory, whoa, Rory, Rory, whoa, whoa,
whoa!
STOP I SAID!!
The hell you doing, Rore? Hunh?
Got a ball game going on here.
We're playing ball, you come out
here with a gun? The goddamn hell
you doing?
Lay it down, Rory, you're drunk.
Lay it down!
Don't do it, Rory! Don't you do
it!
He didn’t give me a choice.
You should be sleeping.
Peggy, I...
I knew what I was gonna say before
I got here...
I'm real sorry, Peg. I liked Rory,
I liked him a lot.
Pastor, Charlie...
Medical examiner still here?
Charlie, whatever the costs are for
the funeral, bill comes to me, all
right?
Just wanted to get his bloodalcohol,
put in my report.
Come again?
I heard what you said. Stacy,
that's not right, he was drunk.
Russ.
Yeah.
So you all saw something last night
I sure wish you hadn't...
...Hard to make sense of it, even
for me. Talk to your teachers,
talk to me if you want...
...We don’t have all the answers,
but we’re here to help.
Yeah. Dad swore he wouldn't last a
month down there. Then he saw the
golf courses.
Hungry?
What do you want?
Sit.
Could drive you up to see your
parents this weekend, if you want.
Thought maybe the moon was full, I
don’t know, definitely some
weirdness going around. Medical
examiner said he found nothing in
Rory’s system.
Meaning, according to the state,
the man I shot was sober.
Saw him at lunch and he seemed
fine.
Looked him right in the eye. He
was under the influence of
something. If it wasn’t alcohol it
was something else.
Dutton...
I'm coming.
Farnums’, the whole place is going
up.
What happened, Bill?
Bill, what happened here tonight?
Was hoping to transfer him, we’re
not really equipped for this sort
of thing. Okay, two o'clock.
Looked at me last night like he
coulda slit my throat and barely
known the difference.
Same look Rory gave me. Same
goddamn look.
What're you lookin' for?
Yeah, do that.
Got us a pilot, where's the plane?
I know he's a lyin' bastard.
Travis.
Say that again you'll be the second
person I shot this week.
Something came real close to taking
a bath.
Know what that is?
Then don't touch it.
It was a big plane.
'Cause we're right on top of it.
Say, you folks missing a plane?
No? Well somebody oughta tell that
to the pilot in our morgue.
Military, yes, ma'am. Dutton. D-UT-
T-O-N. Yep, I'll be here.
Plane that size goes down and
there's nothing in the paper,
nothing on the news? Make any
sense to you?
Hopman Bog, what's that drain into?
Which drains into...?
Black Pond? Is that right?
Russ, where the hell you think we
get our water from?
Which way's the water flow through
town?
Drinking.
Whose house does it get to first?
Next house is Bill Farnum's. I
mean, am I talking nonsense here or
is it possible they reacted to
something they drank, something in
the water?
Farnum's are a mile out, might not
have made it this far yet. Tell
everybody don't drink it.
I’m shutting it down, Tom.
Either I'm losin' it completely or
I just saw a guy in a spacesuit out
by Hadley Road.
Did we or did we not request a
transfer to Wichita this morning?
Yup.
Even better.
You know what...
We're in trouble.
What'd you hear?
Lizzie, run down the station, tell
Russell what you just told me, tell
him I need him asap.
Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie, if that's you, say
something!
Charlie?
Jim - ?!
The A & P has plenty of bottled.
Bruce’s agreed to sell it at cost
till we work out another source.
Thanks again, Bruce.
I know, Nathan. Russell’s on his
way to Wichita right now, see if we
can get some answers.
What - ?
Maybe you should go stay with your
parents for a while.
Look, this isn't --.
What? What was it?
Somebody there?!
What the fu--?! Get off her!!
What did we get exposed to?! What
was it?!
So they round us up with assault
rifles, what's that?
In plainspeak.
Hey Tom, how's Kentucky?
Wow, sounds like your civil rights
might have been violated, you
should look into that.
You ran. Town needed a leader.
It's not our town anymore.
Same ones who don’t know anything
about a dead pilot and aren’t
missing a plane.
now! Hey, do you hear me?!
Get away from her! She’s not sick,
she’s pregnant!
LEAVE HER ALONE!!
Judy...
Kevin! I gotta get outta here!
WHAT?!?!
They took Judy.
What do you want me to do, Ed?
Anybody heard what it is yet? What
they spilled?
What?
Let ‘em have it.
Judy's a fool's errand?
Tell you what, Kev. You don't ask
me why I can't leave without my
wife and I won't ask you why you
can.
Stop surprising me like that.
They let you guys out?
I’m going to get her.
You don't know that.
Russ, we got enough problems
without you inventing ‘em.
Who's the sheriff?
Who's the sheriff of Marsh County?
I am. Who's the deputy?
You are. Deputy does what the
sheriff tells him, that's the
balance of power. Now I'm telling
you you're not getting sick,
understand?
That’s the school! They’re
bailing! Come on!
You okay?
Where are you going?!
That truckstop where fifty hits the
county line, they're taking people
out of there, putting them on
buses.
Wichita maybe, wherever, some safe
zone.
My cruiser's back at the house.
I'm thinking the power line road.
It's crap, but we can drive it.
Exactly.
You’re not sick.
If you’re sick, I’m sick -- we
drank from the same tap -- and I’m
not sick. Not yet anyway. So
let’s keep walking.
It’s not human nature’s doing this,
it’s a chemical.
Shit! Get her out of there!
Down down down!
In there.
Shut her up!
Pray they don't do a headcount.
Aw Jesus...
What's your name?
From who?!
Billy, I want you to tell me what
exactly the fuck is going on down
here.
Nobody’s said anything about what
it was they spilled?
How’d it go?
How? The truckstop?
Cool it, Russ.
We're not staying here.
Yeah, we're gonna hold onto those,
Billy.
That’s why.
Let’s get to the house.
I told you why.
Judy, wait!
What are you doing?
Stop.
None of this matters. You know
that.
We'll have to take our chances on
the highway. Power lines will take
too long.
Stay with them, I'll be right back.
Yeah. How ‘bout you?
You don’t know that.
He saved my life, that’s what I
saw.
Goddammit.
I left the water at the house.
Fifteen miles.
I’d worry about her.
Hey Russ.
Russell!
Let’s get the car.
Can’t drink it anyway.
That your car out front?
Hey, is that your car out there?
Can we borrow the keys?
Shit, get back!
Russ, I called to ya, you kept
walking. We were gonna pick you up
down the road.
What would you recommend, dear?
We’re five miles the other way now.
What? Where?
Somebody turned it on!
Goddammit!
RUSSELL!!!
EVERYTHING’S FUCKING MOVING!!
Come on, come on, come on...
And you know why.
I’m feeling persuasive.
It'll drive on the rims.
Bastards.
Move!
Did you just block out the last
seventy-two hours of your life?
They're not even gonna stop.
Russ! Russ! Let me talk to him!
What did you people spill?
The guy standing between you and a
bullet.
What were we exposed to?
What’s he talking about?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
you guys engineered this crap?!
You got any idea what it does to
people?!
How about ‘sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town’?!
You guys are gonna let us die here
for one-in-a-million odds?
NOOO!!!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?! I SAID I
WANTED TO TALK TO HIM!!
I’ll get the guns from him.
He's a good kid, but I'll kill him
if I have to.
Thanks.
I'll carry 'em for a while. You've
been carrying 'em the whole time.
I got 'em.
Yeah.
Stop talking. Let him think about
what he's doing.
No. Give him a target he'll hit
it. Let me think a minute.
Fuck it, I'm gonna confront him.
We don't get to that truck stop
we're dead anyway.
I want to talk to you.
Just wanna talk.
Put the gun down.
Put it down.
I just want to talk to you.
Can we talk? Man to man?
Okay. Here's the deal --.
Yeah.
Ten fifteen pounds.
They'll see us.
Come on. We're there.
It was Grand Central last night.
In what...?
Nobody leaves.
We don't get outta here nobody's
ever gonna know what happened.
Whatever they want.
All these roads are gonna be
blocked.
Thirty miles to Wichita. On foot,
avoiding main roads, we’ll average
maybe three four miles an hour.
That gets us there by daybreak.
I don’t know. We gotta move.
Truck’s still there.
Fuck.
They’re coming.
Climb!
Lock 'em!
See if any of those work!
What are you doing?!
Hurry!
YEEEAH!
Perfect.
That's everything!
Anything?
Anything?!
Nothing?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
GET DOWN!

How my brothers and sisters doing
today? Doin' fine.
What say to some nice Al Green for my babies, huh?
What you? ... You get hell on out of here.
... Comin' in here ... goin' to urinate on my babies.
Mac wants the what??
What's happening?
Where are you?
The dogs?
'Tweren't no dog, Bwana.
Okay now, Mac, run this by me again.
Thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes, right? ..And the ....
MacReady!
Well, go on.
I just can't believe this voodoo
bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Cool it, Palmer!!
So, MacReady, come on now. These
Norwegian dudes come by ... find him and dig him up ...
Now how's this motherfucker wake
up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
You buy any of this, Blair?
You're saying...that big muther in the ice, became that dog.
He got both choppers and the tractor
... I don't know how bad yet.
I can get maybe another five or
six feet out of it.
Hhat is it?
Where's the other half?
They could be hours ahead of us,
Mac.
Where's the other one?
What we going to do?!
But....
Bullshit! You left it open so
they could get out!
Don't you be telling me ...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Whose uncontaminated blood we going to use?
That key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
So what?! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! Bullshit!
I'll take it...
What do we do about those three?
You can eighty-six that thought
right now, man.
No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.
Ain't it there?
Be quick.
Oh, no.
No. The generator. You got the
auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.
Where's the damn flashlight?
You fellas okay over there?
Cut that out, Copper.
Nauls? What's taking you?!
That's impossible, man! Okay,
Clark, out of the john where I car: see you!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Where's ... Where's Garry?
Where are you, Garry? Don't you
move an inch, Copper.
Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!
Clark, you want me to come in after
you?!
MacReady!
Garry's missing!
Gee, thanks!
Where'd you go?
I said where? Where'd you go?!
You lying bastard ...
You sit back qown....
Well, who says I want you going
with me?!
Don't walk behind me.
Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.
My babies.
Now who'd go and do....
Let go me...
What's it going to do, being a
plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
You stupid, sonofa ...
No one's that strong, boy!
W asn't enough time. Generator was out, what? .. Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
He was working on a test. Fuchs must have been onto something. These bastards got scared and got rid of him.
...Hey... Where's...
Nauls!! MacReady!!
How long they been out now?
We better start closing off the
outside hatchways.
Cut him loose?
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
... Nothing human could have made
it back here in this weather without a guideline ...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here ...
No. Just let him freeze out there.
Then we're wrong.
Damnit, he's got the keys.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
You been made, MacReady.
Move in slow now.
We ain't buying that.
You're going to have to sleep sometime.
What for?
You ain't tying me up.
Then kill me.
I guess you do.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
So Clark was human, huh?
So that makes you a murderer.
Let's do it, Bwana.
Muthafu ....
Get me... get me the hell away from
... cut me loose, damn it!
Spaceship of some kind.
Did you kill it?
What do you mean 'you think so?'
It'll turn black again soon enough.
Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing ...
... Think my toes are already gone.
So you're the only one who made it.
The fire's got the temperature way
up all over camp... won't last long though.
Maybe we should try and fix the
radio ... try and get some help.
Then we'll never make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
I guess I'll be learning.

So... what do you think?
Yes.
Let her go. It's cool.
Ellie, you heard your m--.
Ellie! Are you all right?
Anyone who can scream that loud
isn't ready for intensive care just
yet -- looks like she just skinned
her knee.
Would you get the first aid kit?
Jesus, the road!
Yes -- thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
No. I Guess not.
Hey -- they actually found the
place.
Well, maybe I --.
Great.
Well, I've got a million questions
about the are, and --.
I really do have a million
questions.
It's me.
Not at all.
Jesus!
Where does it lead?
Pet cemetery?
My daughter's got a cat. Winston
Churchill. We call him Church for
short.
I'll take it under advisement.
And yours.
Church! God, you scared the life
out of me!
Alright, Missy. Thanks.
My God!
Not yet. How much
farther?
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Fine. Come and see.
For a little while.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Hi, babe.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Lovey... Church might still be
alive when you're in high school...
and that's a very long time.
If it was up to me I'd let Church
live to be a hundred... but I don't
make up the rules.
She was a little over-exited,
that's all. Poor kid.
All at once he's my friend. Rachel!
Rachel, Church is going to fie.
Honey, we can't be sure of th--.
There's nothing wrong with a child
finding out something about death,
Rachel. In fact, I'd call it a
necessary thing. Ellie's reaction --
her crying -- that seemed perfectly
natural to me. It--.
Ellie has known where babies come
from since last year.
It does, though. When I was talking
to her about Church I got thinking
about my mother and how she spun me
that old cabbage leaf story when I
asked her where women got babies.
I've never forgotten that lie.
Children never forget the lies
their parents tell them.
I have to go. Big day tomorrow.
Maybe I'll get you drunk first.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
The road's a lot more dangerous
than any operation. Church will be
just the same. Well -- almost the
same -- and we won't have to worry
about him being turned into catburger by one of those damn
Orinco trucks. Church will be
alright, honey.
Well, honey... you know that...
Church will be fine. I promise.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if
something should go wrong while
he's under the gas -- it's a one-in
a-thousand shot, but it happens --
you explain it to her.
Gotta go.
-- nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy
How's that belly-ache of yours?
You ought to see a doctor about it.
Not so much as a sprain.
Get her out. Get them all out.
Steve, get the ambulance over here
right now. He's gotta go to EMMC.
-- a new muffler, oh shit --.
Help me hold him.
It wouldn't matter if we had the
SST.
He's going, Steve, go call the
motor pool. Marcy, roll out the
crash wagon.
I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules!
There wasn't even supposed to be a
sprain today, my friend. That's
what I told Rachel.
W-What did you say...?
How did you know my name?
Dammit, how did you know my name?
Get a sheet.
He said my name. I heard it. He
said my name.
Oh. Thanks God.
I don't like this dream.
I want to wake up. I want to wake
up, that's all. I --.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me
alone. It's not my fault you dies;
you were as good as dead when they
brought you in --.
Gettin' ready.
Good d--.
Just comin'.
That's why you're going with the
kids and without me. As far as your
dad's concerned, I'm never going to
be part of the family.
I'll be around plenty when you get
back.
Say hello to your folks.
Hello?
Jud? What trouble?
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Yeah. It's Church.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer
plenty.
Yes.
Put him in the garage, I guess.
Bury him in the morning.
Guess that's what it's there for,
huh?
I... I'll have to mull that one
over a while. Maybe... maybe when
they call I'll just tell Ellie I
haven't seen the damn cat around.
You know, I don't want to spoil her
holiday. And Rachel's.
Jud, this is crazy. It's dark. It's
late. And cold.
It can wait until tomorrow when we
can see.
Yes, but --.
Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
Creed dreamland.
Nothing.
Do we plant him on the outer circle
or start a new one?
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll
break our necks.
Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.
God, this is amazing!
-- and don't look down. Right --.
Holy...
I'm alright! I'm f--.
Sure. I guess I just lost my happy
thoughts for a second there.
It does bite.
Where are we going, Jud?
Jud? What's --.
What in Christ's name...?
Is there quicksand?
Are there ghosts?
You're telling me.
It's funny, alright.
You keep saying that.
What is this place?
Whose burial ground?
Why? For God's sake, why?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Pax vobiscum. Church old buddy. You
were a hell of a good cat. I doubt
if you were worth all this
aggravation, but you were a hell of
a good cat.
Oh, shit! Rachel!
Jud... what did we do tonight?
Is that all we did?
Hi, Dory... it's Louis --.
That's be real fine.
Hi, babe. How are things out there
in Chicagoland?
Well... I guess he's just fine,
Ellie. I haven't seen him this
evening, but --.
Yuck! Kiss your own cat!
Church!
Food, Church... food!
Come on, Church! Chow down!
Christ. I don't believe this.
You stink, Church.
In a second.
Chewed his way out. Jesus
Baldheaded Christ, he ch--.
Ow!
What did we do?
I tried to tell myself I buried him
alive. I'm not a vet... it was
dark...
I feel like I'm going crazy...
Your mother knew all about it. All
about... that place.
That's why you took me up there?
Has... has anyone ever buried a
person up there?
How the hell did you get in?
Hi, sugar!
Yes... I guess so. He was sleeping
on the front porch when I left.
That was a silly dream, wasn't it?
Yes.
I know.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
the money, Ellen.
Yes -- I hate it, too.
Yes. To honor the dead.
Well... a touch of the flu...
That's enough, Ellen.
Hop in.
My father used to have a saying,
Jud -- "God sees the truth, but
waits."
It's Ellie's cat.
What's up, sugar?
Well, I think Michael McDowell is
so full of shit he probably squeaks
when he walks... but don't you dare
say that.
I don't know, honey. Different
people believe all sorts of
different things. Some believe in
heaven or hell. Some think we're
born again as little children. Some
think we just wink out... like a
candle flame when the wind blows
hard.
No. i think we go on. I'm not sure
what happens after we die, but I
think we go on, yeah -- I have
faith in that.
Oh, faith's a little more than just
believing.
I thought maybe you did. I know you
don't approve of the subject.
Scared of what? Dying?
I know she died... spinal
meningitis.
Rachel -- babe -- don't --.
Was it that horrible?
Rachel, that's enough.
Shh -- that's forgotten.
If you were, I salute you for it.
Yes, I salute you for it. And if I
needed another reason to... to
really dislike your mother and
father, I've got it now. You never
should have been left alone with
her, Rachel. Never. Where was the
nurse? There should have been an R.N. They went out, they actually
went out and left an eight-year-old
kid in charge of her dying sister,
who was probably clinically insane
by then? Where was the R-fucking-N?
To get you a valium.
Tonight you do.
If you told me this before, it
would have explained a hell of a
lot.
Just a little phobic. Yeah, right.
No apology needed. But what the
hell, I accept it anyway, it it'll
make you, feel better.
Hey, Gage!
String! You're flyin' it, Gage --
you got the hammer, ma man!
Bet your boots. Look --
See?
Bet your ass, little hero.
What can you d--.
NO!!
No... squatting out there at the
Holiday Inn like a couple of
vultures. He wants Rachel to go
back with them after the funeral.
Her and Ellie.
Ellie --.
Good night, Ellie.
Yes -- I suppose, you can. Good
night, Ellie.
Fuck off, hairball!
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm
very tired. I wonder if we could
just --.
I'm thinkin' about going to bed.
What...? Jud, don't talk crazy.
I'll bite -- what's the bottom of
the truth, Jud?
Tell to my wife and little girl.
What happened?
You're saying the place knew Gage
was going to die.
This can be the start of patching
things up with your folks. If
something good doesn't come of
Gage's death, I think I'll --.
Better get goin', hon.
Come on, you guys -- before you
miss the boat.
We all lost our minds, Irwin.
Be good to your mother, darlin'.
I'll be there in three days -- four
at the most. I've gotta get the
electricity shut off and square
things with your school so the
truant officer ain't after you, and --.
Of what?
Everything's going to be alright,
Ellie.
I swear.
I think we got it all.
It could be.
It's wrong.
What happened to you is wrong.
I'll tell you where the ground is
sour -- the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something
else, Vic-baby; Wrong is wrong.
He was my son! He wasn't even two
and he was run down in the fucking
road and he was almost in pieces.
And if don't think I'm going to
try...
If it doesn't work -- if he comes
back like Jud said Timmy Baterman
was -- I'll put him back to sleep.
And they don't even need to know.
Rachel and Ellie never need to
know, I've got to try.
Gonna bust you out, son.
Oh, Gage -- oh, honey.
It's going to be alright... I swear
it's going to be alright.
Please, God -- let this work.
Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna
look down.
See? Just imagination.
It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.
Come back to me, Gage. Come back to
us.
Jesus!
Gage --?
Oh my God.
Gage!
Hello!
Yes -- I'm here.
Yes, she's fine.
She... Rachel's asleep.
I'll call you right back.
Irwin, you'll just have to --.
Gage?
What did vou do? What did yo-
What you buy is what you own, and
sooner or later what you own comes
home to you. Wasn't that what you
said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much
it?
Hi, Church. Want some grub?
Don't mind me. Eat it while vou
can. Eat all you want.
Eat all you can... all you want...
that's right... todav's
Thanksgiving for cats, but only if
they came back from the dead...
No you don't.
Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be
dead.
Rachel?
Jud?
Gage?
Gage?
Alright, Gage... let's.
I'm sorry, Jud. I'm sorry. I'm --
I'm going to set things back in
order. I... I know just what to do.
Gage?
I waited too long with Gage. But
Rachel� it will work this time.
Because she just died... she just
died a little while ago.
It will be alright, Rachel. I
promise. You'll see, Rachel --
-- a man's heart is stonier.
A man grows what he can... and
tends it. Because what you buy is
what you own...
And what you own always comes home
to you.

It's getting there.
Huh?
Oh... uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Yeah, I'm fine. Just really hot upstairs.
Dad's fixin' something again. Hit the deck!
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Yeah, you know how it is...
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Ah, nothing.
Look at this car. Are you kidding?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Knit this, Grady.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Get outa here.
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Not too far. My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Yeah, why?
What the hell are you talking about?
You're full of shit.
Hi! You didn't have to wait.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady? Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Yeah.
Grady?
It better be you, you son of a bitch!
Holy shit...
Holy shit...
Dad!
DAD!
No. I'm okay.
Really. Just a bad dream.
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
Hi.
No, that's okay. I was just...unpacking.
Yeah?
There's a box of sweaters over there if you want to put them up in the closet.
You know her?
Traumas of a ten-year old.
That's typical. I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
That's it? Wait, she skipped a week.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Okay...
Are you sure?
I'll walk you downstairs.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Well it sure isn't leaky gas pipes.
What are you talking about?
I don't have to listen to this!
What do you want?
Why did it take them five years to sell this house, Dad?
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away? And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Only it was more like, you know, sleepwalking. All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Forget about going back to sleep after that. I was up all night. I finished reading this. It gets real crazy towards the end, after all the death stuff. But then she said something really freaky - about her mother taking her down to the basement to show her the glove.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Fred Krueger. The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her. Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
I may be late. Baseball practice!
It was okay.
My Dad. He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Sorry. Schneider id it to me again.
What's all this.
Like a haunted house, right? I don't believe in ghosts.
Yeah, I know... synapses neurong...
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.
Where are we going?
What is this place?
What's this?
What do you mean?
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I feel like a jerk.
Uh-uh.
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
Yeah?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on. Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and... Until I fall asleep.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Whoa!
I don't know - a sharp pain.
It's gone now.
No... Oh God, no...
No!!!
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.
Can I go to bed now?
I'm okay. Just leave me alone.
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
yeah, I had a bad night.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
Oh God.
Oh Jesus. I'm gonna be sick.
I'm not hungry.
There's nothing to figure out.
Shut up, Grady.
It's late... go back to sleep.
Morning.
Fine.
Be out in a minute.
I think I better go. I'm just not into it tonight. I'm sorry.
Will you leave me alone? Please.
What are you gonna do? How are you gonna help? I'm losing my mind. I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
I'll see you.
I'm sorry...
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I killed Schneider, Grady...
Only it wasn't me - I was there but it was like something inside of me, moving me around. Then last night it made me go into my sister's room and tonight, with Lisa in the cabana. We were... on the floor - I felt it happening again.
It wanted me to kill them, Grady!
I'm scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy. But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
No!
I don't know - everything's all mixed up.
What difference does it make? I'm in trouble here. I need your help.
Just watch me. If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
And Grady...
Don't fall asleep!
Grady?
It's happening again.
No!
No! No! No!
You son of a bitch! You killed him!
I killed him! I killed him!/l>
I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
Fred Krueger.
He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours... He's gonna take me again.
No! Christ, how can I make you understand? He tried to make me kill Angela last night! Look at the blood on my hands!
Oh, God. I did that to Grady...
He owns me.
Oh, God, he's coming back!
Get out of here, Lisa!
I can't!

Hello?
...Hello?
Father?
Father, what are you...
Jesus!
Oh, that, was bad, that was bad...
I shouldn’t have done that...
Shit.
Those people! Who were... who...
I’m a bicycle courier. I was riding
a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut
across me... and then I wake up in
hospital, today... I wake up and
I’m hallucinating, or...
Jim.
Where are your families?
No... No! I’m going to find them.
They live in Greenwich. I can walk. I’m going to... to go and...
Yes! I’ll go and come back.
Down there. Westlink Street. Second
on the left.
I understand.
I understand.
I’m not grateful.
My old room was at the end of the
landing. You two take it. I’ll
sleep down here.
It’s empty.
Help!
It’s Mr. Bridges...
He lives four doors down...
That’s his daughter...
No... No! I wasn’t!
No!
I... I don’t know. I think so.
How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?
The blood was everywhere. On me, on
you, and...
How long had you known him?
Let’s hope we don’t have to get out
of here in a hurry.
No. You?
I do need a break, by the way.
Nothing.
I’ve got a headache.
Pretty bad.
Because I didn’t think you’d give a
shit.
...Do you have Sprite?
Jesus!
I can’t.
Let us in!
I’m Jim.
This is your place, then.
It’s nice.
There aren’t any others in the
building?
Yes. Fine.
It’s fine.
I’ll take the living room.
Good night, Frank.
Very shredded.
So what do you make of them?
...I think they’re good people.
Yeah.
Right. Because if they slowed you
down...
In a heartbeat.
I wouldn’t.
Selena - you think I don’t get it.
But I do get it. And I know I’d be
dead already if I hadn’t met you.
No, look - I mean thank you.
Good night.
Morning.
They’re all empty...
Right.
It’s a recording?
The North...
Maybe they’ve got a cure.
Get there how?
Then we should go the indirect
route. The one in broad daylight.
That isn’t underground.
I knew this was a shit idea. You
know why? Because it was really
obviously a shit idea. Driving into
a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars
and broken glass is really fucking
obviously a shit idea.
Oh no.
The world’s worst place to get a
flat.
...You heard that?
Holy shit.
Fuck you!
You’re getting out?
Wait!
It’s okay. I think you can eat this
stuff raw.
It isn’t any crap. It’s whisky. It
might be good to have.
Jesus Christ. We’re never going to
be able to get out of London.
Nice cut-through.
...What?
We don’t have any cheeseburgers.
“Stay close.” It’s like going on
holiday with your fucking aunt.
No.
Who’s unbelievably hungry?
Let’s have a picnic.
These are great. They’re like huge
biscuits.
An de phraisins ar phrill moipht.
I said, the raisins are still
moist.
You know what I was thinking?
That’s what you were thinking.
About what?
That’s what I was thinking.
Uh-huh. You stole my thought.
Ah, keep it.
Nor can I. It doesn’t feel safe,
outdoors like this.
I know. I noticed that too.
Selena... Selena!
How did you manage to get to sleep?
Valium. Great. Not only will it get
us to sleep, but if we get attacked
during the night, we won’t even
care.
Two each?
What about...?
Fuck you!
What...
Okay, Dad.
Here you go, Frank. This is how you
catch dew. I’m covered in the
fucking stuff.
Bloody hell...
But, the whole of Manchester. The
whole city...
It can’t be...
Try the horn.
It looks deserted.
They didn’t all leave.
Yes.
We were hoping for...
I didn’t know what to imagine,
so... We just feel lucky to have
found you.
You’re keeping him alive?
And has he?
...So how is she?
Hey, don’t...do that. Look,
Hannah... Hannah’s what Frank said
she was. Tough. Strong. And just
like me, just like you, she will
cope...
Cut it out!
Look. We’re grateful. Very grateful
for your protection, and just to
have found other people. But if
we’re going to stay here with you,
you’re going to have to stop your
men from -.
I haven’t killed anyone.
A boy. I killed a boy.
Yes.
What?
Get up. Get up!
We’ve got to get out of here!
We’re leaving. Now! NOW!
... Quarantine?
Hannah! Selena!
That was longer than a heartbeat.
Listen to me. I’ve got to tell you -
I’ve got to tell you. The world
isn’t fucked. It’s going to be
okay. We’ve got a chance, if we can
get to...
Ow!
I was kissing her!
Are you stoned?
Just fucking do it!
Jesus. Not the curtains too.
You looked all right in this, you
know.
Do you think he saw us this time?

Sharks are equipped with two long

I know you have a visitor off your

be my shark.
Sir, I'm not with these others ---.
I'm interning at the American
Museum of Natural History, but the
Oceanographic Research Institute in
South Africa is co-sponsoring my
thesis paper arm in arm with the
Natural Institute of Health and the
Marine Fishery Service.
I'm trying to prove that the shark
that killed Christine Watkins last
Friday was the same rogue that
savaged these. 
The trail of a rogue shark leads
all over the world. This is only
a theory. It has never been authenticated,
but there is a wonderful
chance that the shark that killed
the Watkins girl and the man-eater
I tagged off the Great Barrier Reef
are the one and the same. Off and on
I've tracked it to New Zealand,
Santiago Bay, Cape Town South Africa
...uh...the Gulf of Guinea, then
West Palm Beach, Florida last
December -- and finally predicted
it would follow the warming Gulf
Stream into the Northern Seasonal
Zones, and release an attack pattern
along the Jersey Coast. I was off
by just three hundred miles. It
hit you instead.
All I'm asking is for a little future
cooperation. I could predict future
outbursts of attack activity in the
area. Use me...Let me use you. I
scored 93 on my Orals, for crying
out loud!
No sir, I couldn't.
By letting me see Christine Watkins.
I'll look at her now if you don't
mind.
I've heard the boat-propeller story
several times. And the nocturnal
hatchet-murder story, the dashedupon-
the-razor-coral story --.
The little boy was never found?
They're very successful creatures,
sharks. Eighty million year's
antiquity for the species of the
Great White. The family goes as far
back as three-hundred million. Plenty
of time to get good at what they do.
No, this one's a blue.
It's sure big enough -- ten point
six feet.
I'm not so sure. Blue sharks pretty
much operate on the warm-water law,
and limit their attacks to seventy
degrees and up.
Ocean's fifty-five.
The Great White's body temperature
in the lateral musculature is almost
eighteen degrees above whatever the
temperature of the water. I don't
know if this is our bite culprit.
Only one way to know for sure...
...and since it's not my shark, I'm
not slitting open the belly to see
what portions of the boy is still
inside. Am I...?
This could be it. He's big
enough all right, but I still
can't be sure until ---.
I won't know until I perform a
full autopsy.
Well, there's dolphins -- but they
talk too much.
There're good things to be said
about meshing. It's worked in
Australia for years. Repellent's
a myth. Now there's a cable available
charged with 7,000 amps that
could be strung along the entire
bathing area.
Matt. And I don't drink alcohol,
but thank you.
We think the Great Whites possess
an electrical sense ---.
This is a very good rendering,
Mike. Looks like a thresher.
Where'd you learn to draw him?
Get bitten by the subject...or
just morbid curiosity?
I picked this up in Macao. There's
supposed to be a superstition about
these things -- that if you keep it
with you, you'll be safe from shark
bite.
He was a witness?
In case you haven't caught the
island gossip, I never take baths
-- just showers.
Aquaphobia or what? Mind if I
smoke?
I'm going to try and snag the old
boy with 3/32 of an inch stainless
steel aircraft cable.
Brought my own cage, thanks. If
this really is my shark, he's got
a Peterson disc tag on his anal
fin. It can't be seen from a boat.
Biotelemetry. It's a radio collar.
I bell the cat and then follow him
anywhere. I'm trying to make a
deal with a satellite tracking
station at Houston, Texas.
Well, I'll never take him without
a fight, but --.
That's the game plan.
I know what you're saying, Martin.
Nature has no conscience, Mr. Brody.
What I said was, I'd help predict
future attacks in your area. If
this device works, the early warning
to other shorefront resorts --
not just here, but anywhere it
ranges in the world ---.
I'm staying at the Abilard Arms.
I really liked dinner.
Very deep -- looks like a school.
Mackerel. Really clumped together.
Staying right with us.
Tends to. Gets very still down
there.
I'd better see the damage first.
Did he have a dinghy on board?
Be up in a minute.
A White -- it's a Great White, I
knew it...! Looks like he died
of fright in there.
One this big could do anything!
Meet Carcharodon charcharias.
The shark that just bit you on
the hand.
And this...is you.
Seventeen feet from anterior to
posterior.
The famous Swedish naturalist Linnaeus believed that the 'great
fish' that swallowed Jonah was not
a whale, but a great white shark.
The longer there's nothing to
munch on here, the better your
chances he'll go. That means, of
course, keeping your beaches
closed, your fishermen in port.
The other alternative is noncorrosive,
100-gauge steel mesh --
say, 30,000 feet of it around your
bathing area. Concrete blocks and
installation would run you...oh,
four, five hundred thousand. That
is, unless you could seek a deputation
from the federal government --.
Beats getting swallowed, doesn't it?
Might be for you, Mr. Brody. I
think it's all over.
The sea is full of fish again for
one thing. You won't find sea life
in the territory of a Great White.
All the fish we saw in the ocean
today. You'd think they were celebrating.
I played low-frequency
music underwater -- that usually
works faster than blood.
There are signals in the water. I
can always read them. And the currents are shifting.
I'd take them, sure. Lookout posts.
An alarm system. If you can afford
picket boats equipped with sonar
repellent line across the bathing
area. Jesus...we must have gone six
times around this crummy island.
You'll never be immune to attack.
It knows where you live now. Goodnight.
I feel the same about you.
He's in shock. Get blankets!
I can read signals in the water --
when they're around -- when they
leave. I saw the signals. It
moved on. They reported an attack
up the coast, toward Ipswitch, Maine
today. Oh, Jesus, Martin, I'm sorry..
Powerhead, C.O.2 darts...hypo...
regulator...tanks...depth gauge....
Maybe I'm in the wrong area.
Thanks. I'll see you.
Anti-shark cage.
If necessary.
That's right.
Let's go.
Careful! Compressed air -- you
crack that and it explodes like a
bomb!
And they have brains the size of
a radish.
Can't bring him up so quick ---.
I'm okay....
Why over there?
I can do more than that. Look,
Quint, I brought along a ---.
Closer to thirty feet....
What's the formula...?
Girth, say 150 inches. Squared
and...divide by 800 -- that's six
one, five...6150 by 2000 --.
Just over three tons.
Your harpoons are attached to
these. right?
They pop up and drag on him, drag
on him till he's through -- isn't
that the idea?
What if we have to follow him?
Put that away!
You've got the monopoly, huh? Here!
Look at this one.
Bull-shark scraped me. I was down
getting samples, and he ---.
Eight-foot moray eel -- right
through the suit, buddy.....
Minor League. Where's it from?
A what? You got a what?
Let's move in on him.
You kill him?
How'd you get that one?
The scar on your arm.
Changed your mind about somebody?
You were on her? June '45?
Jesus, Quint! You can't blame ---.
A whale's out there.
I told you I have things to kill it
with...take over up there, I can --
Quint!
He had a turn, now I'll have a turn.
Maybe you should have a turn, too.
Strychnine nitrate, 20 CC's.
All you need to do is lower me in ---.
You know he'll go for the cage ---.
I can finish him in sixty seconds.
Can't you stop this Moby Dick crap?!
Coming right to us!
We can't rev it up this high ---.
Don't shoot him any more! He's
crazy on his own blood already!.
I can't see him!
Your pumps are out too. Drop me
down to twenty feet or so, okay?
Try and keep him off me till I'm
down.
Lower away, Chief.
Don't talk. We've got a long way.

I need to stretch my legs. I'll
follow you.
For what.
That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.
He looks dead.
He's not breathing, Mom.
This is kind of a cool place.
Will you give Mom a break?
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
Okay. I'll flip you for it.
Owwww! You little shit!
You're beautiful.
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better
to do than follow me around all
night?
Well, I...
Well... yeah. Sure.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
It's early. Why do we have to
go home?
I'll hitch.
Mom, just give me five more minutes.
Just five minutes, okay?
Come on, Sam, you know before
there were malls there was 'like
the ocean.'
See you later.
I'll pass.
Hi...
What's your name?
Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I
came this close to being called
Moon Child, or Moon Beam or
something.
But Star's great. I like Star.
I'm Michael.
Sort of. We used to come here
summers when I was kid. Now
we're here on a permanent basis.
Are you hungry? Wanna get
something to eat?
We still going?
That's right.
Star?...
I can't beat a Triumph.
We were gonna grab some food.
Where are you guys from?
I mean, where do you live?
You live here? Your folks let
you?
What?...
Worms!
Don't! Stop!
Good joke, blood.
Go away.
Entertain yourself.
I can't remember much after the
Chinese food that looked like
maggots.
What would that make Mom?
Beat it, Nanook.
No. Why?
I told you it was pretty weird
Chinese food.
No.
Ouch.
I wouldn't have given my Mom
such a hard time about moving
here if I'd known I was going to
meet you.
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Mom's home?...
Oh, shit...
Hi, Mom...
No. I'm up.
I watch him all day. The only time
I have more myself is at night. Let
Grandpa watch him.
Okay.
Big date, Grandpa?
Oh, yeah. What'd you stuff for
her? Mr. Johnson?
Don't bother.
Piss off.
What's that?...
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He
bit me! This is my blood!
He was protecting you!
What??
Help me! Sam -- help me! I'm
your brother!
We've got to stick together, Sam.
You've got to help me.
No! We can't tell Mom!
Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
Just for a few days, Sam. Give me
a chance to work this out by myself.
Star?
Star. I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you. Please
wake up.
When?
Sure.
We are...
I'm tired now.
Mom... please.
Can't. Got plans of my own.
Gotta go, Mom.
Yeah. Max... right?
Come in, come in. I'm inviting
you.
See ya.
Where is she?!
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
I know everything.
I don't know.
Okay.
Do you know where David took me
tonight, Star? Do you?!
That night in the cave -- that
wasn't wine they gave me to
drink... it was blood! David's
blood.
I'm one of them, Star! I'm just
like them!
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
I know, I've felt it...
You're not going anywhere...
Star.
Who are you calling?
Of course not!
David.
I'll take you there.
I said, I'll take you there.
Nobody's going near Star without
me.
Down there.
Sam... if something happens to me.
If I don't have the strength to go
on, promise me you won't let them
hurt Star.
Star. You're coming with me.
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
Huh?...
Take him outside, Sam!
No, Grandpa...
They'll be coming for all of us.
Sam, don't --.
Duck, Sam.
David!
Catch!
I... I don't feel any differently.
Do you?
I didn't invite you in this time!
Get out, Mom! Run!
It's gone. I feel it!
Everyone accounted for?

(beat).
(very unsympathetic).
(sweet self).
(nasty).
(softly).
(beat).
(mumbling).
(moving away).
(beat).
(turning).Sorry.
I’m back.
No, it’s okay. It’s just going to
have to be okay.
I’ll be fine.
Tommy and Miguel... everybody else
you’ll meet. All my old friends. I
guess that’s the point. Getting
everybody back together.
Maybe they’re overcompensating.
Tough to just call people up after
two years.
No.
I mean, I ran into her once. I saw
her and David going into the
supermarket together. I couldn’t
deal. I just sat in the car until
they left. A little bit after that,
I heard she just disappeared.
Yeah, while we were still married.
She loved it. I couldn’t stand it.
Somebody’s bawling while you feel
fine. Someone’s passing out cookies
while you’re coming apart. It just
made me angry.
I didn’t want anyone’s help.
You could’ve put odds on our
divorce, I guess.
Yes they do.
Though this is just the kind of
thing she’d...
Jesus!
I don’t know. Animal.
Stay here.
Don’t come up here.
We can’t leave it like this.
Just go back to the car, okay?
How the fuck can she go back to
that house?
And I’m not.
I don’t think things work that way.
Lot of money in Eden’s family.
Wasn’t ever mine.
I look like a dirty dishrag?
It never thrived.
Where’s Choi?
Is Eden...?
Me too.
No. Not really.
Of course. Sure.
Hey. How are you?
What does that mean?
It’s not...
A tire iron.
Mind if I look around?
Eden?
Eden!
Christ...
Sorry. You scared me.
These bars on the windows are new.
That’s nice.
Is that where you were for the last
two years?
Yeah. I did.
It’s not hard for you to be in this
house again?
You look different.
What are you talking about?
Eden.
Has she been like this the whole
night?
She’s like a different person.
I didn’t?
What? Really?
I don’t know. I don’t really know
how to act.
No.
Where’s Amanda?
How are Robbie and Lucia?
What’s up?
That’s not good.
It’s good to see you.
Okay. How’s work? You’re up for
tenure, right?
A year ago. Really.
I’m sorry. About...
I don’t know why anyone would call
your teachings gloomy.
I don’t know.
Why don’t you just leave the key in
the door? It’s like a fortress in
here.
I never heard about that.
What if there was a fire?
You’re very dirty there.
Yes. Attention to detail is
incredibly important.
It is my credo.
Why don’t you go back to bed,
buddy? We’ll be quieter.
So that’ll be the time he saw his
gross parents having sex.
He could probably use one
I just don’t understand why you’d
show something like this at a
dinner party.
Don’t. Just don’t.
I know.
Yeah...
It’s all right.
Sorry, I...
Thanks. I know. I miss you.
Nope.
Hey Miguel. Can you tell what this
is?
Seriously. I found a bunch of it in
Eden’s bedroom... unlabeled.
Come on, just look at it.
Is that dangerous?
Let’s just drop it.
Not much new to report.
I just meant that...
No. Not at all.
Why?
Thank you.
Am I alone here? This is odd, isn’t
it?
I’m not kidding.
They don’t seem right to me.
Just let her go, David. Why can’t
she just leave?
Just let her do what she wants.
I’m good.
You want me to walk you out?
I’ll be there in one second.
Sure.
You chose us?
I’m sorry you feel that way.
Maybe... I wasn’t prepared to be
here.
David, please. Please.
I don’t pretend to know what you
went through with your wife. And
you don’t know me. You can’t.
I don’t... why would you say that?
She’s great.
I’m gonna try to make a call. I’ll
see you in there.
What?
I think you should go inside.
I don’t know you.
Sadie.
I don’t want to do that.
I just needed a break.
Tommy, there’s something wrong
here. Something bad is happening.
It doesn’t feel safe here.
What do you want me to do?
Oh. That’s all?
Okay.
Where’s Choi?
Where’s Choi? Where the fuck is
Choi?
I just got a message from him. He
said he was here. That he got here
at seven.
He said he was here.
Where is he?
I got a message from him. He said
he was here. He was right outside
when he called.
Don’t lie to me. He called from
your front door!
Why is everyone is being so fucking
polite? Where is Choi?!
No. This isn’t right. Something
very strange is going on and no one
is saying anything.
Who are you? I don’t get why you’re
here.
Two years. We don’t see you for two
years. And then suddenly you invite
us to this lavish dinner... all
smiles, spewing all of this
jargon...
... with these two in tow. Don’t
tell me this is normal. The
Invitation?
It’s a cult, Miguel! A fucking
cult!
Our son died, and you’re ignoring
it! You are just... you’re trying
to make me ignore it, too. How can
you do this?
Look at the video. It isn’t about
communion or family. It’s about
denial. It’s a fucking brainwash.
It meant something when he died.
Don’t erase... we haven’t even said
his name tonight! You’re trying to
erase him. Ty was real. It was
real. It is real.
Please, Eden... where is Choi?
Don’t patronize me, David.
Tell me why the doors are locked...
Tell me why there are bars on the
windows. Tell me why there’s a big
fucking bottle of phenobarbitol
stashed in your bedroom.
No! Something is going on.
Something dangerous, and we’re all
just ignoring it because David
opened some good wine!
I...
David.
I’m fine...
Eden, I’m so sorry...
It’s very difficult for me to be
here.
You’re right. It’s none of my
business.
I’m very sorry.
Excuse me for one second.
... keep washing... ten seconds at
least...
I can’t.
I’m just... Kira, I’m not okay.
It isn’t good. This is not good.
I’ve had help. It doesn’t work.
Nothing works.
My son is dead. Where do I put
that?
it. It’s like a scream trapped
inside of me.
And there’s no changing the fact
that I wasn’t watching carefully
enough that day.
I can’t live with that. I can’t...
Another kid. I can’t even feel...
Ty loved him. They were just
playing. Just messing around. I
shouldn’t have let them have the
bat. But he’s just a kid. So I
can’t even.. I can’t...
It was just a kid.
I’ve been waiting to die since the
moment it happened.
Look at Eden. That’s what letting
go looks like.
I love you, Kira. But I don’t think
you can help.
I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.
Can I look at his room?
God. Oh god. Oh god.
Don’t drink it! Don’t fucking touch
it!
Don’t drink it!
We have to get out of here!
Let’s go.
Do not drink that!
Gina. Gina...
Choi! No!
Kira!
Ben! Ben! This way!
Try to find a light, Kira...
Kira.
No.
Kira....
We can’t just wait here. For them
to come. He has a gun...
We have to get ready. We have to do
whatever it takes. They are just
people.
I know you will.
Let me go first.
There’s a door to the garage. Up
there.
Look for keys. Something to open
the window. Something....
Where is it?
We can get through this.
We’re gonna make it.
You have to get the gun.
She shot herself, David!
We have a gun!
Kira.
David! Don’t do it!
Eden...
We’ll meet you on the road, okay?
Oh my God.
Kira. Stay with me.

(kissing her).

Pruitt).
(looking up).
(pause).

(pause).You didn't have to come, Hawes...
This is between me and Jason.
Seeing it won't. But destroying
him once and for all will.
Jason belongs in hell.
I'm gonna see he gets there.
You bastard!
Yeah. Fuck you, Jason.
Don't shoot. Please.
You gotta do somethingl
Jason's alivel He killed my
friend, now he's coming for mell
Will you listen, dammit!
Jason is alive. We dug up
his body. I was gonna cremate
it and...
Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do
something. He's even more
powerful now that ...
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me
because ...
There's no time for this
bullshit ...
Jason's got to be stopped.
No ... Ya gotta listen. Jason's
coming back here. He's after
me. I tried to destroy him
but I fucked up ...
Why didn't you cremate him?l
If you'd just go to the
cemetery, you'll see I'm
not lying.
You're gonna be sorry you
didn't listen to me.
I got a bad feeling of what
might've happened to them.
You've got to convince the
sheriff to look for your
friends. Hopefully, they're
fine. But there's a very
good chance that Jason ...
I'm not dangerous, believe me.
Jason is out there. He's
looking for me. But there's
every possibility he'll
return to the camp where
it all started.
Yes!
But they have to be warned,
Sheriff. Jason will return
to the area that's familiar.
No matter what you call it,
it's still Camp Crystal Lake
to him.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Please, Sheriff. You'll see
we dug it up.
That's not right. Somebody
covered it up ...
... I gotta see it ...
Who covered up Jason's grave?!
Jason's not in his coffin!
Hawes is! Dig it up! You
gotta dig it up!!
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got
to talk to your dad. About
Jason. I've got a plan. I
need to buy some things first,
but mainly need help to ...
I already have a very good
idea what could've happened ...
... Megan, Jason is out there.
He has to be stopped. I'm
positive he's heading back
to the lake area. He'll
keep killing until ...
What?
Uh ... Howie's Service Station
and Feed Bag Stop. I think it's ...
I'm gonna borrow your car.
You can't do this with me.
It's much too dangerous.
What?
Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.
I'm already responsible
for causing the death of ...
Uh... yes. But ...
Can this tub go any faster?
Okay. There's one.
Please don't do anything
crazy.
Whatever you say.
It's just beginning.
You got me where you want me.
There's no reason not...
Doesn't that tell you
something?!
Jason did do it. I swear!
Sheriff, when were they
murdered?
Damn.
So what are ya drawin'?
I was just curious about
what she was drawin'.
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
Better do as she says, 'cause
... wherever the red dot goes,
a bullet is sure to follow.
Got the keys?
Sorry, Megan. Not this time.
I thank you for getting me
out. But I gotta finish
what I started.
I got a bad feeling we're
already too late.
It probably wouldn't have
any effect on him. The
only sure way to stop
Jason is to return him
to his original resting
place, where he drowned
in 1957.
Crystal Lake.~.where the
nightmare began.
I hope so.
Megan, wait!
No, Meganl
Megan! Use your dad's car
radio and call for assistance
... and an ambulance!
Whew ... Okay, hand me
those padlocks.
Yes. And I said, hand me tose padlocks.
I hope not.
Megan! Get back into the
cabin with the kids.
Megan, please!
Megan, get in there with
them before it's too late.
Megan!
JASON!!
Come on, Jason! It's
me you want! Come and
get me!!
That's it! Come on, pus-head!
Hey, asshole! It's me you
want, remember?! Come on,
chickenshit, I'm sittin'
here waitin' !
It's over, Megan. It's
finally over. Jason is home.

(worried).
(exhausted).
(impatiently).
(adamant).
{sighs; relieved).Time to play Spam in the can.
Is that an offer?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like
that. Coffee?
Coffee.
Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves
that...
I am your best friend. I am a
lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
I heard it.
...cancel our leave and send us out
on some bullshit mission...!
Laymen's terms.
I can see why they sent you along.
Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?
From what?
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for
this?
...come on, Skipper, I already put
my shoes on...
I'll be all over it.
You still need the rope? I thought
you were one a those spacemen with
ice in ya veins.
You just keep your nose clean, Baby
Bear. Clear the door.
Hey, Baby Bear, Mama Bear got a
corpsicle for ya...
Baby Bear, you copy?
Justin, do you copy?
...do you copy?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck
are you?
Justin?
What's happening?
350 meters... 400 meters...
I'm gone!
Hold on, Baby Bear...
Oh my God...
Justin, do you read me? Justin... .
Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do
this...
We have a man down...
The containment, Second Containment...
I told you. He was inside the Core...
It was like... nothing was there...
and then Justin appeared and the
Core... became metal...
You weren't there. I saw it.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a
fucking "optical effect!"
You been out there a long time. Trying
to break my record?
What?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical
on me.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in
your mix.
We'll have to re-route through the
port conduit to the APU.
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to
repressurize the Clark.
Cross your fingers.
We're still venting trace gasses,
gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm
coming in.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
Can you shut it down?
I don't want to go where the last
crew went. I'd rather be dead.
...and the gravity drive goes where
no man has gone before.
Will it work?
I'm gonna activate the emergency
beacon.
Starck?
What...?
It's over, hush now, it's over...
(serious now).
(turning on Weir).You're so predictable.
What the --.
I'm sixteen, Keri. I should be
able to live wherever I want.
Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom.
Now can I move into the dorms?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet
away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make?
All right, I was wrong. There is
a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
My life is a living hell.
To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
You're twisted.
There you are.
You tell 'em about tonight?
Shelve the barf bag. It's the key
to the main gate.
Swiped it from my mom's desk
yesterday.
I borrowed it.
I am in need of some serious
partying.
Why not?
Molly, you're the resident
assistant. What are you gonna do, narc on yourself?
Just meet me in front of the gate
after lights out.
Don't worry... I hear he only
kills virgins.
Condoms are on aisle four...
Nothing.
I just went for a walk. It's no
big deal.
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live
in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Just forget it...
Nah, I didn't tell her where I
went.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You saw that Michael Meyers
display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You look kind of cold.
Here, take my jacket.
Better?
That was classic... "Michael, nooooooo!"
I'm sorry, all right? It was just
a stupid joke.
You some kind of fugitive or
something?
Now you're joking, right?
Wait a minute... slow down...
you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Any other psychotic relatives I
should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly? She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
What? Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
I just can't believe she's dead.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I
just call you Mom?

(pointing out the
kitchen window).
(whispering).
(louder).
(imitating Keri).Forget Peter Vincent.
I love you more --.
Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've
been going together almost a year and
all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"'
I'm sorry, Amy.
You mean it?
Amy, you're not going to believe this,
but there are two guys in the yard
below. And I think they're carrying a
coffin.
Amy, I'm serious.
Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to
see this.
AMY --.
Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin, but I
did see two guys carrying something
into that house --.
No, Mom, nothing like that.
Mom, we're in high school.
Yeah, goodnight.
Mom, there are people. next door.
What new owner?
To who?
The bastard. Why didn't he tell us he
was going to spring a pop quiz?
Hey, Amy --.
Buzz off, Evil.
No, next door.
Mom, you seen the new guy next door
yet?
No, i don't think so.
Ah, nothing. Got to study. See you
later.
Hi.
It was?
Look, Amy, I. love you. I never.. want to
fight with you again, okay?
What?
You're sick.(staring at him).
Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't
believe what s happening next door.
He has fangs. The man who bought the
house has fanas!
Mom, I don't need hot cocoa. I didn't
have a nightmare. They did kill a girl
over there.
Mom, I'm not sick. The guy did have fangs and a bat did fly over my head and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of
the shadows. You know what that means,
don't you?
He's a vampire!
A vampire, damnit! Haven't you
listened to anything I've said?
Forget it, I'm going to the police.
All right, then I won't tell them it's
a vampire. But I sure as hell am going
to tell them about the two women --.
That's a lie.
I saw him carry her body out in a
plastic bag. What do you say to that, Mr. Cole?
The bag I saw had a body in it, not
trash.
No, but --.
Look, I can prove he's lying. Let's
look in the basement instead.
A coffin, that's what's down there, a
coffin. I saw them carry it in!
Lieutenant Lennox, please, listen to me--.
Evil!
The vampire knows that I know about
him. Or at least he will when he wakes
up tonight.
I've got a vampire living next door and
he's going to kill me if I don't
protect myself.
Look, Evil, I haven't got time to
explain. Just tell me what to do to protect myself.
I'm not kidding. Evil, please, just
tell me what to do.
Look, I've got eight bucks. Tell me
what' to do and it's yours.
In my bedroom. Tonight.
What?
That's all?
You sure about that?
Yeah, Mom --.
What's he doing here?
You what?
Yeah, fine. I've just got to get back
to my trigonometry, that's all.
The vampire is in the house. My
idiot mother just invited him over
for a drink.
Ed, this is serious!
Yeah, and I nailed my window shut.
You sure?
I, I just had a nightmare.
Nothing, Mom. Just the raccoons in the
garbage again. Why don't you go back
to sleep.
I'm fine now, honest. Night.
Get him, Peter, get him --.
Hey, Mr. Vincent --.
Could I talk to you a minute?
Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly
important.
Pardon me?
No, sir. I was curious about what you
said last night on TV. You know, about
believing in vampires.
Were you serious?
What do you mean?
I believe in vampires.
In fact I have one living next door.
Would you help me kill him ?
You know the murder of that girl that
happened yesterday?
Well, the'guy who lives next door did
it and he's a vampire.
Mr. Vincent, I'm not joking. I'm
deadly serious.
But, Mr. Vincent, I'm telling the
TRUTH --.
You just said you believe in
VAMPIRES --.
Please, you have to listen to me. The
vampire tried to kill me last night - and
trashed my car when he didn't
succeed. He'll be coming back for me
tonight and if I don't get help, he's
going to kill me --.
Mr. Vincent, you've got to believe me --.
Mr. Vincent--.
Self-defense. Not that I think
I'll need it. He'll be dead before
nightfall.
Dandrige. I'm waiting for the guy he
lives with to leave, then I'm doing
to go next door, find his coffin, and
pound this through his heart.
You can't murder a vampire, Amy.
They're already dead, remember.
I don't have any choice, Amy. The
police won't listen to me, my mother
thinks I'm crazy, you two, even Peter
Vincent thinks I'm nuts.
See. After he attacked me last night
he went out and had his dinner.
No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody
has to stop him. Hold on, I need
ANOTHER STAKE.
I told you, I already tried him.
Why should he believe you anymore than
he did me?
Fat chance.
I don't know --.
No, you're right there.
All right, try him again..
AMY --.
You don't believe me, do you?
Who is it?
He did. When?
But Dandrige will be out of his coffin
by then.
I don't know. Maybe he didn't take it
Honest?
Then maybe we it really have a chance
to kill Dandrige tomorrow night.
You two don't know what it's been like,
knowing there's a vampire living next
door and having no one believe me --.
It's six ten. He said he'd be here at
six, right?
Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this --.
There.
Where're your stakes and hammer?
But I know he's a vampire.
You're not going in there without them?
He did?
But, Mr. Vincent, if I'm right and
you prove he's a vampire, he'll kill
us all right then and there.
But, Mr. Vincent, you don't know how
powerful he is. He can change into a
bat and fly through the night --.
BUT -- Billy Cole opens the door, his face lighting up when he
sees Peter. He shakes his hand warmly.
Where do you keep your coffin? Or do
you have more than one?
Damn right, I did; Only the cops didn't believe me anymore than any of
you.
But you'll believe me in a few
seconds. Mr. Vincent, give him the
holy water.
Get ready to run. I'll protect you
with this.
But, it can't be --.
Then it wasn't blessed!
If he's not a vampire, then have him
touch this?
No, no, of course not.
Yes.
C'mon, let's get out of here --.
What's wrong with you?
Then why are your hands shaking?
You saw something in there, didn't
you, something that convinced you he
was a vampire?
Is Jerry Dandrige a vampire or not?
Please, Mr. Vincent, you have to tell
me. Our lives depend on it.
Mr. Vincent, you have to call the Police - and tell them --
SHIT!
Well, at least you two heard him.
Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had
no reflection.
you, Amy? Remember the way he looked
at you?
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first.
Because it's after dark, pencil.dick,
and there's a vampire back there!
No way. We want people and lights,
the more the better.
What if you're wrong, Evil? What if
Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks
you know it. Would you walk down
that alley then?
Ed, please, just stick with us.
Let him go. No vampire's gonna want
hint anyway.. Probably give him blood
poisoning.
Where is he?
Ed, Ed, are you all right?
Jesus, I warned him --.
You asshole, you fucking asshole!
You'll get yours someday, Evil.
How much further?
What was that?
Amy, what if Evil really was in
trouble?
Don't tell me it's a power outage.
I think we lost him.
It's all right, Amy.
We've got it made.
Run?
Over here --.
HERE --.
Eighteen.
The police.
Yeah, give me Lieutenant Lennox.
He doesn't believe me.
I won't let him get you, Amy. I
promise.
She can't handle this, Amy.
We don't have any choice, Amy. Now
give me his number.
C'mon; Mr, Vincent, answer, please,
answer.
Answer me, damnit, answer me --.
Mr. Vincent, this is Charley Brewster.
You gotta help us. Jerry Dandrige has
me and Amy trapped in this club --.
But you have to come, Mr. Vincent.
You're the only one who knows what's
going on.
If you don't, Dandrige'll kill us!
God damn him. He-won't help us --.
Pardon me, have you seen a girl, light-haired --.
I'm looking for a girl --.
Let her go!
You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- !
You can't kill me here --.
Let me go --.
That's her, over there with that older guy.
C'mon, quick --.
Hold on to me --.
Amy!
Charley Brewster. Let me in.
What are you talking about?
What are you, doing?
You can't.
No, they won't believe you. I've
tried.
Peter, it's just us. Were going to
have to save Amy.
I know.
Yes. You're Peter Vincent, the Great
Vampire Killer.
I can't do it alone, Peter. If you
don't help, Amy's going to die. And
me, too, probably.
Please, Peter.
Yeah, me, too.
What?
Peter, this is serious.
What about Billy Cole? What's going
to stop him?
What if he's not human? Bullets
aren't going to stop him then.
Peter --.
What's wrong?
Too late.
This way.
No.
Amy'll be dead by then, too. Now come on.
Where's Amy?
Stop!
We're gonna make. it --
AMY --.
What have you done to her?
You bastard!
No!
Peter?
Help, let me out!
We can't. Look.
Is it too late to save her?
Are you sure?
Let's go --.
Come on, we have him --.
What did he mean?
He wasn't human.
Peter!
She's worse. C'mon, we're running
out of time --.
Where is he?
Well, he was here --.
God' damn him. Where is he?
Yeah, but what's he doing up there?
I'm going up there.
No.
Peter, behind you!
You okay?
Amy --.
Oh, my God --.
He's downstairs now --.
No!
Come on --.
What is it?
What?
Yes.
Well, now we know what he did with
the mirrors --.
You keep searching. I'll check it
out.
Who's there --.
Amy --.
Get it open!
HURRY --.
No!
AMY --.
No, nothing.
