<l>I got it.</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Yes?</l>
<l>Who is this?</l>
<l>Cory Gillis. 442-8730.</l>
<l>Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M...</l>
<l>Enjoy the movie.</l>
<l>Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.</l>
<l>I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek.</l>
<l>Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?</l>
<l>What murders?</l>
<l>What's going on?</l>
<l>What's going on, Dewey?</l>
<l>Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?</l>
<l>Oh my God. How could it happen?</l>
<l>It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.</l>
<l>Yeah, right.</l>
<l>No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.</l>
<l>You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.</l>
<l>Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...</l>
<l>No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.</l>
<l>I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.</l>
<l>Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.</l>
<l>No PDA.</l>
<l>This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?</l>
<l>You're not allowed to ask that.</l>
<l>Thanks, Joel.</l>
<l>It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.</l>
<l>No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie.</l>
<l>Hello, Gale.</l>
<l>I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...</l>
<l>Yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.</l>
<l>It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.</l>
<l>My morn was a Delta.</l>
<l>Randy? What are you doing here?</l>
<l>Cotton...</l>
<l>What are you doing?</l>
<l>You BITCH!</l>
<l>Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.</l>
<l>Any news?</l>
<l>The forbidden subject.</l>
<l>It's starting all over again.</l>
<l>I'll get my jacket.</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Who are you?</l>
<l>What do you want?</l>
<l>Then come and get me.</l>
<l>Derek. He's in the house. Help... me...</l>
<l>Please, I have the perfect excuse.</l>
<l>Gotta.</l>
<l>Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.</l>
<l>This is exactly what I don't want.</l>
<l>But...</l>
<l>My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.</l>
<l>What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?</l>
<l>Shit. Did I?</l>
<l>Yeah, right.</l>
<l>It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.</l>
<l>I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.</l>
<l>Do you work for her now?</l>
<l>Me, too. Randy. Me too.</l>
<l>Wanna get outta here?</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Cotton.</l>
<l>I don't think that's a good idea.</l>
<l>What do you want from me, Cotton?</l>
<l>I did that.</l>
<l>How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that?</l>
<l>Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.</l>
<l>Did it?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable.</l>
<l>I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.</l>
<l>I have this button I press. See? It insulates me.</l>
<l>Thanks for the movie, Randy.</l>
<l>No, it's not.</l>
<l>It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.</l>
<l>I'm sorry, Derek.</l>
<l>Excuse me? Did your computer just freeze?</l>
<l>I'm not signed on.</l>
<l>He's here. He's in the room right now.</l>
<l>No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.</l>
<l>Someone else has been killed.</l>
<l>I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break</l>
<l>I'd really just like to be alone.</l>
<l>Dewey, there's no such place.</l>
<l>No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.</l>
<l>But who would operate your camera?</l>
<l>He's cool, Remy.</l>
<l>It's not a good idea, Hallie.</l>
<l>Whatever.</l>
<l>Where are you taking me?</l>
<l>I feel like Eddie Murphy.</l>
<l>SOMEBODY PLEASE OPEN UP SOMEBODY!</l>
<l>Oh God, help me. We have to call the police.</l>
<l>Do you have keys? I need to get inside.</l>
<l>Shit!</l>
<l>Mickey? Mickey?</l>
<l>Oh God, no, Mickey...</l>
<l>Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.</l>
<l>He's after me.</l>
<l>I'll be right back.</l>
<l>Watch out.</l>
<l>Don't panic.</l>
<l>Watch out.</l>
<l>Hey.</l>
<l>Hallie?</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Hallie?</l>
<l>No. This is a set up.</l>
<l>Why?</l>
<l>You're not going to get away with this.</l>
<l>Gale!</l>
<l>Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live.</l>
<l>But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that.</l>
<l>You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos...</l>
<l>Mrs. Loomis?</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>Why Mrs. Loomis?</l>
<l>You'll never get away with this.</l>
<l>NOOO!</l>
<l>Please, Cotton, don't do this.</l>
<l>It's over, Cotton.</l>
<d>(complete throw away).</d>
