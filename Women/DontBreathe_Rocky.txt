<l>Twenty... Nineteen... Eighteen...</l>
<l>Ten-nine-eight-seven...</l>
<l>Relax, nobody is coming back.</l>
<l>Seriously. How hot do I look?</l>
<l>Not as much as Money does.</l>
<l>No?</l>
<l>Okay okay, my turn...</l>
<l>Would you ever -- lose three fingers from each hand? Like, all you'd have left would be these scary little nubs.</l>
<l>What about you, Alex?</l>
<l>I'd consider it.</l>
<l>Guess it depends on whether I'd have to swallow, or not.</l>
<l>And soon, Money and I will be out of here too. We keep hitting houses like today's --.</l>
<l>-- and hola, California.</l>
<l>What? He's living here now?</l>
<l>'kay then give me money.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Yeah. Just got it.</l>
<l>A butterfly. But its wings haven't grown out, yet.</l>
<l>Forget it, it's stupid.</l>
<l>When my dad left us, my mom started using, made her into venom. Said dad leavin' was my fault, everything was fine 'til I was born.</l>
<l>I missed him, used to cry and cry for hours. One day my mom got so fed up, she locked me up in the trunk of a car that was hitched to the back of the trailer.</l>
<l>She'd keep me in there for hours, even days.</l>
<l>There was this tiny little hole in the trunk. This butterfly would fly in, it actually kept me company. Made me feel safe. I'd close my eyes, and imagine myself as this purple butterfly, that'd fly away.</l>
<l>When I leave this city I'll finish this tat, ink its wings, that'll be the last time I ever mark my body.</l>
<l>Why don't you come with us to LA? It'll be sad without you.</l>
<l>Bring him. Can you imagine the kind of trouble you and I can get into in Hollywood? What if I get 'discovered'? How crazy would it be to see this face, in a movie?</l>
<l>You think the money's in the house?</l>
<l>We won't get caught. Not if we do this right.</l>
<l>He'd kinda right. We got this heisting down to a science. If we're lucky, this will be the last house we'll ever rob.</l>
<l>Cool.</l>
<l>Where?</l>
<l>For real?</l>
<l>That's amazing. Wow. I promise Alex, you won't regret this.</l>
<l>This is gonna be cake.</l>
<l>We've done sleepers before. No big deal.</l>
<l>Oh my God. What the --.</l>
<l>Let's get outta here. Now.</l>
<l>Kind of fucked up to rob a blind guy, is't it?</l>
<l>How do you know?</l>
<l>You got four keys with you?</l>
<l>And why have locks that can only be opened from the inside?</l>
<l>What's it do?</l>
<l>Where's the master keypad?</l>
<l>What about that?</l>
<l>You calling me fat?</l>
<l>Remember this? The "loco shoulder"? You tried to kiss me in second grade.</l>
<l>I was so freaked out, I kicked you in the nuts, then you shoved me off the top of the jungle gym. When I hit the ground and my shoulder popped out. Like so --.</l>
<l>It hurts but trust me, I can fit through that hole.</l>
<l>Then I'll kick him in the nuts, too.</l>
<l>I need you two to pull my shoulder. Really fast and really hard.</l>
<l>Pull.</l>
<l>SHIT...</l>
<l>Ok get me up there.</l>
<l>Oh my God. It reeks in here.</l>
<l>I can't breathe. So nasty in here.</l>
<l>Motherfucker.</l>
<l>Oh shit...</l>
<l>Ok, ok here we go. Twenty, nineteen, eighteen...</l>
<l>...seventeen, sixteen, fifteen.</l>
<l>...fourteen, thirteen, twelve.</l>
<l>...eleven, ten. Where are you?</l>
<l>...seven, six, five.</l>
<l>...three, two.</l>
<l>...shit.</l>
<l>Oh thank God...</l>
<l>What da...</l>
<l>AH!!</l>
<l>Guy is gassed and out. In Sleeping Beauty mode.</l>
<l>Heard what? My heart about to explode out my chest?</l>
<l>A safe.</l>
<l>Now what?</l>
<l>You've never fired a gun before.</l>
<l>We are so close to getting what we came for.</l>
<l>Alex... wait.</l>
<l>I found the money.</l>
<l>Well it's our millions, now.</l>
<l>Want us to go to jail? Once the cops realize we used your dad's codes and keys for every heist we've pulled they'll arrest him too. That's what you want?</l>
<l>It's just us, now. You and me. So let's just find a way out.</l>
<l>It's a basement.</l>
<l>We have to hurry.</l>
<l>Which way?</l>
<l>What is this? Where do we go?</l>
<l>Is this a dead end?</l>
<l>Right or left?</l>
<l>Maybe you got disoriented...</l>
<l>We have to turn around.</l>
<l>Alex?</l>
<l>Let's get the fuck out of here please...</l>
<l>Oh my God!</l>
<l>Who are you?</l>
<l>This is why he killed Money... he thought we knew about her.</l>
<l>What's with the mask?</l>
<l>A helmet?</l>
<l>What's your name?</l>
<l>We need to help her.</l>
<l>And leave her down here?!</l>
<l>How long do you think before that maniac finds out we're here? By the time the cops arrive, she's gonna be dead.</l>
<l>The hand cuffs...</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>You can do this.</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>No... no...</l>
<l>ALEX?!!</l>
<l>Alex?! You're okay.</l>
<l>No. I don't want to go back into that house.</l>
<l>Okay, okay --.</l>
<l>Come on... Try the keays.</l>
<l>Oh God no...</l>
<l>Oh God.</l>
<l>Cindy... she was the girl locked in the cellar. She killed his daughter.</l>
<l>What are you doing?</l>
<l>I can't go to jail.</l>
<l>Look.</l>
<l>Fuck. Fuck.</l>
<l>Come on, come on...</l>
<l>HAAAAARG!</l>
<l>Arrrrrrrggggggh.</l>
<l>God. Help me?! Fucking help me!</l>
<l>Yes! Please!</l>
<l>Okay. I can do this.</l>
<l>Please stop!</l>
<l>What have you done to him...</l>
<l>Please. Let me go...</l>
<l>Yes you do. Look, I understand you... I really do. This girl killed your Emma...</l>
<l>Cindy should have gone to jail for that, but that didn't happen. So you lock her up down here. You wanted her to pay.</l>
<l>I know how you feel, but nothing you do to me will bring her back.</l>
<l>That's not true.</l>
<l>HELP!! PLEASE!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!</l>
<l>Please... God, please.</l>
<l>Please stop...</l>
<l>You can't do this to me...</l>
<l>No! NOOOOOOOOO!!!! PLEASE!!!</l>
<l>Don't... Don't...</l>
<l>You son of a bitch. Don't you dare touch me. Hear me motherfucker?!</l>
<l>No. I'm not leaving here without the money.</l>
<l>We need that money, Alex.</l>
<l>Where did he put the cash?</l>
<l>I'm not leaving here empty-handed, Alex. Okay?! Not after what he put me through.</l>
<l>Why did you come here, Alex?</l>
<l>You could have given us the alarm codes, and you would have gotten your share. You know that. So be honest, why did you come?</l>
<l>But WHY?</l>
<l>Then help me live past this nightmare, help me find the cash.</l>
<l>Doesn't matter. He's your dad, he'd never turn you in.</l>
<l>I'm yours, Alex. Let's take that backpack and leave here, forever. Buy a little house on the beach, spend the rest of our lives fucking each other's brains out.</l>
<l>Stop...</l>
<l>I said stop, you motherfucker...</l>
<l>STOP OR I SWEAR I KILL YOU RIGHT HERE! RIGHT NOW.</l>
<l>I'll only ask you once. Where's --.</l>
<l>Tell us where it is. Or I swear I'll torture you til you do.</l>
<l>Where is it?</l>
<l>You know what they do to men like you in prison? Soon as we leave town, we'll make sure the cops find you here. Won't be hard for them to figure out what you've done.</l>
<l>I'm not letting this freak off the hook.</l>
<l>We hit the road, sleep in cheap motels, drink expensive liquor, and finally be free.</l>
<l>We're gonna be fine.</l>
<l>You sick fuck!!! You can't get to me now! You're nothing out here! Nothing!</l>
<l>Oh God no...</l>
<l>Somebody help! Please! Heeeeelp!</l>
<l>Come on...</l>
<l>Alex...</l>
<l>I'm so sorry... This is all my fault.</l>
<l>No. No.</l>
