<l>Hey baby. What you up to?</l>
<l>Oh nice.</l>
<l>Hi Mark!</l>
<l>So I was just calling to see if you were still wanting to get together.</l>
<l>I mean, not concretely. I was just seeing.</l>
<l>All right...!</l>
<l>Well. I’ve now sent her three emails and still no response... I’m starting to get a little nervous.</l>
<l>Yeah. Probably. I hope so.</l>
<l>Well, I don’t LET her. She’s bipolar.</l>
<l>Well - but she’s my sister. And even you admit this last email was different...</l>
<l>Okay. Yeah. You’re right. You are right.</l>
<l>No, I do know you’re right. I just needed to be reminded. Thank you. I’m really lucky to have you.</l>
<l>I love you.</l>
<l>Okay. See you later?</l>
<l>Okay. “Bye Mark!”</l>
<l>All right. Love you. Bye.</l>
<l>It’s just in his tone - you can hear it. It’s like he’s trying to work up the nerve to say something and I just keep staving it off.</l>
<l>Well - what if I scared him? I’m always roping him into my family crap... I’m always leaning on him! I tell him everything! I even called him today in tears because my sister sent me another scary email. What if I’m scaring him off?</l>
<l>No! Not if I went too far! What if I leaned too heavily?</l>
<l>But what if I need him too often? If it becomes a chore?</l>
<l>But he never asks for anything from me! I've never even seen him cry! So I'm the only one leaning!</l>
<l>...no, no, no, no, no, no, no...</l>
<l>Hey.</l>
<l>I’m up.</l>
<l>I wasn’t sleeping anyway.</l>
<l>Okay. I’ll just get dressed.</l>
<l>...Oh yeah?</l>
<l>For when?</l>
<l>I mean - yeah. I’m okay. That was just... very weird.</l>
<l>The...Sweden! I had no idea.</l>
<l>Okay, fine, but I didn’t know you were going.</l>
<l>You already have a ticket!</l>
<l>It’s just -- imagine if we were at a party and someone asks "what are you doing this summer," and my friends say: "oh, we’re all going to Alaska for three months, we’re leaving in two weeks,” and imagine that was the first you’d ever heard of it!</l>
<l>You told me it would be “cool to go.”</l>
<l>I have no problem with you going! I just wish you'd involve me!</l>
<l>You didn't apologize, you said - "sorry." Which sounds more like "too bad.</l>
<l>...I’m just trying to understand.</l>
<l>I don't need an apology. I just wanna talk about it.</l>
<l>I'm not trying to attack you.</l>
<l>Well...I’m sorry! I am sorry. I just got confused.</l>
<l>Come on: Sit with me. I'm sorry. That just felt weird, that's all. I think going to Sweden could be really great for you. That sounds amazing. Are you going for your thesis?</l>
<l>I know! It could be inspiring! Right?</l>
<l>Please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overreact. Please.</l>
<l>I get paranoid. I'm sorry. I'm going through all this stuff and I've been dealing with all this panic and I just - overreacted. I'm not trying to put pressure or accuse you of anything. I just got crazy for a second. I didn't mean to project.</l>
<l>What do you mean?</l>
<l>To Sweden?</l>
<l>You don’t want me to.</l>
<l>After I broke down crying!</l>
<l>Hey.</l>
<l>How’s it going?</l>
<l>Nice.</l>
<l>Yeah!</l>
<l>I think so...! If it’s not completely destroying your guys’ male bonding plans.</l>
<l>Hey Pelle.</l>
<l>Ooh, that’s a nice drawing.</l>
<l>How’ve you been?</l>
<l>Uh, well - didn’t quite finish! But they’re giving me a break this year...</l>
<l>How did you like the anthropology department?</l>
<l>Psychology. Yeah. That’s how you know I’m nuts.</l>
<l>Yeah! I can’t wait. Christian says you’ve got a special thing in the woods planned?</l>
<l>Do you do that every midsummer?</l>
<l>Ooh. What makes this guy different?</l>
<l>...Christian says you’re from a really small community?</l>
<l>Depends on which of those you mean.</l>
<l>Oh wow! Flower children.</l>
<l>What’s your sign?</l>
<l>Cancer!</l>
<l>July seven.</l>
<l>Oh yeah? For who?</l>
<l>Oh...!</l>
<l>No, I mean - thank you. I just... I'm sorry.</l>
<l>I'll be right back. Bathroom. Thank you.</l>
<l>Oh - thank you.</l>
<l>How far are we driving?</l>
<l>Why are you reading that?</l>
<l>What are you doing your thesis on, again?</l>
<l>That’s similar to what you’re thinking of doing - right, baby? For your thesis?</l>
<l>See that, Pelle? You’ve managed to brainwash all your friends.</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>Why??</l>
<l>This is horrible.</l>
<l>Fantastic. Thank you.</l>
<l>I think I might need to find my
footing first.</l>
<l>No, I just need to get settled.</l>
<l>No - go ahead!</l>
<l>You know what? That’s okay. I’m ready.</l>
<l>I don’t. I’m ready.</l>
<l>Yeah, Mark, thanks.</l>
<l>Okay. Yeah. I’ll have that. Thank you - Ingmar?</l>
<l>He’s not. It’ll get too complicated otherwise. It’s fine.</l>
<l>Yeah. It’s good. I’m excited.</l>
<l>A little like I have food poisoning.</l>
<l>I’m sorry. I’m gonna walk.</l>
<l>No, that’s not good. No. No.</l>
<l>No, no, no, no...</l>
<l>They were laughing at me over there.</l>
<l>It’s okay. It’s not that. You’re okay. It’s drugs.</l>
<l>This is a coffin.</l>
<l>Hey! No it’s not.</l>
<l>Fuck you. Stop it.</l>
<l>Don’t look in the mirror. It’s not your face.</l>
<l>“It’s not your face.”</l>
<l>What time is it?</l>
<l>You were almost born... You’re a baby.</l>
<l>MOMMY?!... DADDY?!...</l>
<l>Mommy daddy mommy daddy...</l>
<l>CHRISTIAN?!</l>
<l>No... no.... You’re alone.</l>
<l>You’re alone.</l>
<l>...Christian?!</l>
<l>I got lost.</l>
<l>Christian. Nothing means anything.</l>
<l>Nothing means anything! We’re just alone.</l>
<l>And I felt this presence - like God but not God - and it was telling me this and it was laughing at me.</l>
<l>I felt it laughing! I figured it out, that nothing means anything and we’re born alone and we die alone, and it was getting pleasure from that.</l>
<l>I wanna sleep. How can I sleep?</l>
<l>...how long was I asleep?</l>
<l>Did it get dark at all?</l>
<l>Is it tomorrow?</l>
<l>Where are we going?</l>
<l>Tack!</l>
<l>Thank you.</l>
<l>I love what you’re wearing.</l>
<l>Yeah. Wow.</l>
<l>Can we help at all?</l>
<l>Hello!</l>
<l>Ruben is lovely.</l>
<l>I’m too scared.</l>
<l>Oh - my gosh. Pelle!</l>
<l>Oh my God, not at all! It’s wonderful. Thank you, Pelle. I’m so touched.</l>
<l>Yeah, well - don’t worry. Christian forgot.</l>
<l>Or - I forgot to remind him. It doesn’t matter. Thank you so much for this, Pelle. It’s beautiful.</l>
<l>Oh, jeez...almost three years now!</l>
<l>...You’re joking. It’ll be three in fifteen days.</l>
<l>Oh wow. Congratulations.</l>
<l>We’ve actually asked Ingemar to officiate the wedding.</l>
<l>You did?!</l>
<l>That’s so beautiful.</l>
<l>What happens when you turn 72, then?</l>
<l>Who are these of?</l>
<l>Excuse me? Can I ask if you know what’s happening over there?</l>
<l>Oh no. Rickets?</l>
<l>Do you know what they’re doing?</l>
<l>Like a - sympathetic connection?</l>
<l>Fine. It’s fine. I’m not upset. - I know I should!</l>
<l>Pretty serious-looking cribs.</l>
<l>How real is that stuff for you guys?</l>
<l>Is it scary?</l>
<l>Ja!</l>
<l>Is your baby okay?</l>
<l>Oh, I’m sorry...!</l>
<l>Mine? Oh no, mine are...not here anymore.</l>
<l>Ha. Unfortunately not. It’s okay...</l>
<l>Oh God, no, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said. We’re enjoying our food.</l>
<l>No no. I just shouldn’t have mentioned it..</l>
<l>Okay, thank you. Sorry. I feel silly. Thank you.</l>
<l>Sorry.</l>
<l>Is this gonna be something weird?</l>
<l>...Is this the thing you mentioned last night?</l>
<l>...Do I not want to do this?</l>
<l>Okay. And what is “this”?</l>
<l>What is Ättestupan?</l>
<l>No. I need to try.</l>
<l>I need to not be here right now.</l>
<l>I can’t stop fucking shaking and my teeth keep chattering.</l>
<l>I feel like the neck on my skin is getting tighter. Like I’m choking.</l>
<l>Are you just not at all disturbed by what happened?</l>
<l>Why? What’s happening?</l>
<l>Did they tell you what this is?</l>
<l>No. What’s happening?</l>
<l>NO!!!</l>
<l>Please Christian - we need to leave. This is feeling really wrong.</l>
<l>No, Christian: this is pagan nature worship. This is completely backwards. We shouldn’t be here.</l>
<l>I don’t want to acclimate! I want to leave.</l>
<l>What? Since when?!</l>
<l>So let him have it if he wants it! We shouldn’t be here, Christian.</l>
<l>And why would he trust you, of all people? You’re opportunistic anthropology students.</l>
<l>Oh my God, are you blind? They’re performing pagan rituals out here! People are jumping off cliffs. They depend on nobody knowing about this!</l>
<l>I want to leave.</l>
<l>...Do you not love me anymore?</l>
<l>This is the devaluation phase. We've been in it for a long time now. Next comes the discard.</l>
<l>No - this has been happening for a long time! You’ve been pulling away... And I've been in denial.</l>
<l>Oh my -- you’re gonna walk away now??</l>
<l>You’re just gonna leave me like this?!</l>
<l>Do you have a sleeping pill?</l>
<l>I just need to sleep.</l>
<l>Christian?</l>
<l>Oh!</l>
<l>I’m sorry about last night.</l>
<l>I don’t want us to be fighting, Christian.</l>
<l>Do I want to stay for this?</l>
<l>I’m really sorry, Pelle. Thank you for inviting me, but I really need to go. Can someone maybe drive me?</l>
<l>I don’t know why we’re here, Pelle! I don’t know why you invited us!</l>
<l>But I’m not an anthropologist. I don’t have the foundation to understand this.</l>
<l>What is it?</l>
<l>What am I going through? I’m scared. I can’t breathe.</l>
<l>What?!</l>
<l>That’s not what I’m talking about!</l>
<l>Christian could walk in.</l>
<l>You’re a very empathic person, do you know that?</l>
<l>Can I smell that again?</l>
<l>Are you okay, Connie?</l>
<l>Yeah, it was lovely meeting you, too.</l>
<l>I understand. I might be right behind you.</l>
<l>No. We didn’t.</l>
<l>Connie-dot-Brahms. I’ll write you.</l>
<l>...Simon left without Connie.</l>
<l>Sure! But actually - have you seen Simon?</l>
<l>No. I didn’t. But that’s okay...</l>
<l>What are we making?</l>
<l>Oh! She’s so beautiful!</l>
<l>Do you know what happened with Connie?</l>
<l>Why do you think Simon would leave without her?</l>
<l>I could see you possibly doing that.</l>
<l>Never mind.</l>
<l>What is it?</l>
<l>Ew.</l>
<l>Somebody for everybody, I guess.</l>
<l>Hey, can I steal another sleeping pill? Only half this time.</l>
<l>Could Mark still be off with that girl?</l>
<l>Then what about Josh?</l>
<l>We did see Mark go off with one of the girls last night.</l>
<l>Do you know what we’re doing?</l>
<l>It’s just water?</l>
<l>Josh...?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>There’s nothing there.</l>
<l>I don’t speak Swedish!</l>
<l>Aewobeemeewish!</l>
<l>Aewabeeny-sa-aewonnerstabloo!</l>
<l>Weerabbleeishcobleraymib!</l>
<l>It’s over?</l>
<l>Why? Me?</l>
<l>What do you mean?!</l>
<l>What’s happening?!</l>
<l>What does this mean? What do I have to do?</l>
<l>Christian?!</l>
<l>For what?</l>
<l>What? I can’t. That’s too big.</l>
<l>...I don’t know if this is real, or what’s happening - but... thank you.</l>
<l>Can Christian come with me?</l>
<l>What’s there?</l>
<l>What about there?</l>
<l>...Why?</l>
