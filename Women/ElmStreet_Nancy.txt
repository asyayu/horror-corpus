<l>Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night myself...</l>
<l>He's nuts about you.</l>
<l>Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.</l>
<l>Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...</l>
<l>Worked like a charm.</l>
<l>Nice to have a fire.</l>
<l>Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.</l>
<l>See? You've forgotten the bad dream. Didn't I tell you?</l>
<l>Fingernails?</l>
<l>That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.</l>
<l>I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of ...obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...</l>
<l>He scraped his fingernails along things -- actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose -- sssssccrrrtttt....</l>
<l>I didn't hear anything...</l>
<l>Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.</l>
<l>-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.</l>
<l>Rod...</l>
<l>We should get her out of here...</l>
<l>Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.</l>
<l>But I just don't feel... ready to sleep yet. Please, do I have to?</l>
<l>He means, did you ever drop me on my head.</l>
<l>I don't see why you couldn't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming...</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>It's not you I don't trust. It's...</l>
<l>Okay. Let's do it.</l>
<l>No. That's enough sleep.</l>
<l>You believe this?</l>
<l>I grabbed it off his head.</l>
<l>Go even crazier?</l>
<l>Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?</l>
<l>What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.</l>
<l>It's real, Mamma. Feel it.</l>
<l>His name is even in it -- written right in here -- Fred Krueger -- Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mamma? You better tell me, cause now he's after me!</l>
<l>You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you -- avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded --</l>
<l>You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up!</l>
<l>Screw sleep!</l>
<l>That's enough!</l>
<l>And if you can't do that, you sleep.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?</l>
<l>What happens if they don't do that?</l>
<l>Great.</l>
<l>I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.</l>
<l>I'm into survival.</l>
<l>Oh gross...</l>
<l>Mom, what's with the bars!?</l>
<l>Oh, Mom...</l>
<l>What's with the bars?</l>
<l>Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.</l>
<l>I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.</l>
<l>I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!</l>
<l>So he's alive?</l>
<l>What did you do, mother?</l>
<l>Go on...</l>
<l>Who was there? Were Tina's parents there? Were Rod's?</l>
<l>All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Fine. Stand by your window so I can see you. You sound a million miles away.</l>
<l>Much better.</l>
<l>Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.</l>
<l>The killer.</l>
<l>Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.</l>
<l>Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.</l>
<l>My dream.</l>
<l>Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.</l>
<l>If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.</l>
<l>Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.</l>
<l>You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?</l>
<l>You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...</l>
<l>Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.</l>
<l>Okay.</l>
<l>Night-night.</l>
<l>Hang on GLEN...</l>
<l>Glen. Don't fall asleep...</l>
<l>Glen?</l>
<l>Brilliant. Now what if Glen calls?</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>I'm awake, I am awake. This is not a dream! I am --.</l>
<l>My boyfriend...!</l>
<l>Give me the key, mother.</l>
<l>GLEEENNNNNN!</l>
<l>Glen!! Don't fall asleeeeeep!</l>
<l>Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court.</l>
<l>Hi daddy. I know what happened.</l>
<l>You know he's dead though, right?</l>
<l>I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.</l>
<l>Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?</l>
<l>Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.</l>
<l>-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?</l>
<l>That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.</l>
<l>And you'll be here to catch him, right?</l>
<l>Deal.</l>
<l>Just sleep now, Mom.</l>
<l>Come out and show yourself you bastard.</l>
<l>I'm crazy after all...</l>
<l>Help! Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped! Where are you!?</l>
<l>Get my father, you asshole!</l>
<l>Daddy! Where are you!</l>
<l>Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!</l>
<l>Come on -- he's in here! Daddy! Don't let him kill me too!</l>
<l>HEELLLPPP!!! Daddyyyyyyy!!!!</l>
<l>Hey -- Daddy! Hey! I got the bastard!</l>
<l>DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!</l>
<l>I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!</l>
<l>He's after Mom! Come on!</l>
<l>He's under there! Watch it!</l>
<l>Now do you believe me?</l>
<l>I know you're there, Krueger.</l>
<l>I know you too well now, Freddie.</l>
<l>It's too late, Krueger. I know the secret now -- this is just a dream, too -- you're not alive -- the whole thing is a dream -- so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.</l>
<l>I take back every bit of energy I ever gave you. You're nothing. You're shit.</l>
<l>God, it's bright.</l>
<l>Feeling better?</l>
<l>Nah. Just slept heavy.</l>
