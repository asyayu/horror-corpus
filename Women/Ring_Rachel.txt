<l>Listen, Harvey, you punctilious prick! You touch paragraph two and I'm coming down there and poking your fucking eye out with that little red pencil you like so much!</l>
<l>I am being objective! The congressman is a lying sack of shit and I'm saying so in my piece! Objectively.</l>
<l>You will not bury it -- you will keep it where it is, above the fucking fold, or I'll call Jameson and --.</l>
<l>Harvey -- do not touch my column! Shit!</l>
<l>Sorry, I'm late.</l>
<l>Uh, sure. Call me Rachel.</l>
<l>Yeah. He... certainly is.</l>
<l>Well, sooner or later in life, I think that's a good skill to have.</l>
<l>Rachel.</l>
<l>Yes, and I'm working on finding him some day care. It's just that right now I'm kinda --.</l>
<l>Like you said, he's not the talkative type.</l>
<l>He knows I'm there.</l>
<l>That's his cousin. That's Katie.</l>
<l>Looks like she's sleeping.</l>
<l>Huh...</l>
<l>Listen, I appreciate your concern, but two nights ago he lost his best friend. He's just trying to deal with it.</l>
<l>He'll be okay.</l>
<l>That's right.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>Hey, have you seen my black church dress anywhere?! Aidan?</l>
<l>Have you seen my...</l>
<l>...church dress...</l>
<l>It's fine...</l>
<l>Zip me up?</l>
<l>Thanks.</l>
<l>Ruthie...</l>
<l>Me, too.</l>
<l>You all right, Dave?</l>
<l>Yes, she was.</l>
<l>They must have some theory.</l>
<l>And Aidan.</l>
<l>She never said anything. Nothing that would... help explain what happened.</l>
<l>Not enough, according to my editor.</l>
<l>What're you doing in there?</l>
<l>C'mon. You shouldn't be in her room.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>What's this tape you're talking about?</l>
<l>Katie watch it?</l>
<l>She was acting sorta strange last week, wasn't she.</l>
<l>What's on the tape?</l>
<l>And Katie told you she saw this?</l>
<l>Where's he? Is he here?</l>
<l>How did Josh die?</l>
<l>I heard these kids talking about a videotape.</l>
<l>Not a normal one...</l>
<l>The one that kills you.</l>
<l>As if you'd rent out a movie that'd kill your customers.</l>
<l>Why do you think people spread rumors about these fake tapes?</l>
<l>You get the back?</l>
<l>Okay.</l>
<l>Sweet dreams.</l>
<l>I don't know. Good question.</l>
<l>Maybe.</l>
<l>Be nice, wouldn't it?</l>
<l>Okay, Mister.</l>
<l>I got some homework to do.</l>
<l>Look, Aidan. I know I've been working a lot, but I promise I'll make it up --.</l>
<l>You have lots of time.</l>
<l>No. No one does. But I know you don't have to worry about it.</l>
<l>Katie told you she was going to die?</l>
<l>At ten o'clock.</l>
<l>Time of death, Wade, that's all I want to know. The name's Katie Embry -- pull the report, read the time. That's okay -- I'll hold.</l>
<l>Nice alliteration, huh?</l>
<l>No, I'm not.</l>
<l>Of course, I'm not. I'm cooking too good a story.</l>
<l>Four kids died on the same night.</l>
<l>Whatta you mean "and?" This is huge. This is drugs. This is sex -- all the stuff you like, Harvey.</l>
<l>Wade -- yeah, I'm here...</l>
<l>What's the time of death?</l>
<l>Hi, Dave.</l>
<l>Is Ruth home?</l>
<l>Dave let me in.</l>
<l>He's gone back to work?</l>
<l>Did you know Katie had a boyfriend at another school?</l>
<l>He killed himself last week. On the same night as Katie.</l>
<l>Two other kids from Josh's school also died. On the same night.</l>
<l>I don't know, Ruth. Could she have been into something you didn't know about?</l>
<l>No. It wasn't. That was you and me. Mostly me.</l>
<l>She didn't tell you about her boyfriend.</l>
<l>Ruth, I'm not --.</l>
<l>Oh Ruthie... I'm sorry.</l>
<l>All right...</l>
<l>I believe you.</l>
<l>Nice.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>I was wondering if you'd remember someone. From over week ago.</l>
<l>It's my niece. She... she sorta ran out on her parents. Her boyfriend, another couple, I think they stayed here a night or so --.</l>
<l>Oh?</l>
<l>I imagine the mountains, it isn't.</l>
<l>Quite a selection.</l>
<l>Uh-huh...</l>
<l>You know, I'm a little tired. Maybe I'll take a nap before I drive back./l>
<l>I'll take Cabin twelve.</l>
<l>That's it.</l>
<l>Thank you. I really needed to --.</l>
<l>Look, I know you're not exactly a morning person, although it might interest you to know that the rest of the world sleeps at night and works during the --.</l>
<l>What are you doing?</l>
<l>I wanna show you something.</l>
<l>What do you think?</l>
<l>Take my picture.</l>
<l>No. Scan the rest.</l>
<l>It's an eclipse.</l>
<l>It's supposed to ring.</l>
<l>It'll ring.</l>
<l>I'm not tired, Noah.</l>
<l>That tape didn't scare you?</l>
<l>Four people are dead, Noah. Four people who watched it.</l>
<l>Noah --.</l>
<l>Would you say that I'm gullible?</l>
<l>Easily rattled?</l>
<l>Who made it? Where'd it come from?</l>
<l>Thank you.</l>
<l>Same problem got copied, I guess.</l>
<l>So why do we see picture?</l>
<l>I mean, if there's no control track --.</l>
<l>That means--.</l>
<l>Shelter Mountain Inn, it's off 81. One of their guests left it.</l>
<l>I knew I came to the right place.</l>
<l>Fucking Noah didn't mind at the time.</l>
<l>What's that?</l>
<l>No, I mean up there. At the top.</l>
<l>Wait, whoa, go back. There was something there --.</l>
<l>There's more picture.</l>
<l>It's on the tape... and it's off the screen.</l>
<l>Y'know, I'm late, I really should go --.</l>
<l>I gotta go.</l>
<l>I don't want her to see it.</l>
<l>I did have a problem!</l>
<l>Fuck her, Noah. I'm all bugged about you.</l>
<l>You said the tape was interesting. Then she walks in and suddenly it's not.</l>
<l>I came to you for help and now you're blowing me off.</l>
<l>Or for me, right?</l>
<l>That's all right.</l>
<l>Because you're right. It's just a prank. I mean, it's supposed to scare you, right?</l>
<l>It's just pictures and sound.</l>
<l>Sorry to bother you.</l>
<l>I need your help, Becca...</l>
<l>Do you remember anything about that night with Katie?</l>
<l>Do you remember... how she died?</l>
<l>Did you see her die, Becca?</l>
<l>I know... that you saw something... and it scared you. Whatever you say you saw... I'll believe you.</l>
<l>How did she die, Becca? I want to know.</l>
<l>I will, what do you mean I will --.</l>
<l>Who... who'll show me... who...</l>
<l>I'd really rather watch it alone.</l>
<l>Really.</l>
<l>Come on, show me, come on...</l>
<l>Horses...</l>
<l>...lighthouse...?</l>
<l>Shit -- come back --.</l>
<l>Oh my God...</l>
<l>Anna Morgan...</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Everything okay?</l>
<l>Really?</l>
<l>Huh.</l>
<l>Thank you. Good-night.</l>
<l>Aidan --.</l>
<l>NO!</l>
<l>Why. Why, baby, why...</l>
<l>LEAVE HIM ALONE</l>
<l>Noah... it's you...</l>
<l>You do, huh.</l>
<l>He watched the tape...</l>
<l>Our son.</l>
<l>Do me a favor. Unplug it.</l>
<l>Time to go, Mister.</l>
<l>They were horse breeders -- And and Victor Morgan. There were problems with their horses, she was depressed, she was seeing doctors...</l>
<l>...her hospital was U of Maine, at Orono. On the tape there's a hospital room. At my house, I saw a hospital room --.</l>
<l>We don't have time. You visit the hospital, I'll visit the island. The images on the tape, they're leading us somewhere. We have to follow them.</l>
<l>The ladder, the fly, the room... Katie saw them all too...</l>
<l>I think before you die, you see the ring.</l>
<l>No one else can ever see this. Ever. If my time runs out --.</l>
<l>-- you have to destroy this. So it ends with us.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>Hey there, shh, it's all right --.</l>
<l>Settle down, stop, hey --.</l>
<l>I was wondering if you'd have a moment to speak with me. My name's Rachel Keller -- I'm a writer. With the --.</l>
<l>Uh, well...</l>
<l>I didn't mean to... it's just I wasn't able to find a number... to reach you --.</l>
<l>I was hoping you had a few minutes.</l>
<l>I read you had to put so many down. And others... they drowned themselves. As if they sort of... went crazy.</l>
<l>Something scaring them, maybe.</l>
<l>Where are your horses now?</l>
<l>You don't?</l>
<l>She... she killed herself?</l>
<l>It must have been hard on her... the problems... with the horses...</l>
<l>I... well, I...</l>
<l>Do you know what this is?</l>
<l>It won't make sense, what I want to say... but I want to say it. Sometimes people who are dead, they say... still try to communicate. To send messages. To us, to the people still living. And I think this tape... may be a message. From your wife.</l>
<l>Your wife is on this tape. She's there, right in that room. You see the lighthouse, the horses, your horses, her horses --.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Mr. Morgan, hear me out --.</l>
<l>Mr. Morgan --.</l>
<l>Aidan, the house you drew for me...</l>
<l>Did you see it in your head -- is that why you drew it? Was it a picture in your head?</l>
<l>Aidan, why did you draw that house?</l>
<l>Who... who told you to...</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Do you know Victor Morgan?</l>
<l>The Morgan horse farm, Victor and Anna Morgan --.</l>
<l>Can you tell me... They had a child, didn't they. A girl.</l>
<l>Can you tell me about her.</l>
<l>And what was that?</l>
<l>What happened to the girl? Samara?</l>
<l>Because Morgan sent the girl away?</l>
<l>Where is she -- where's your child?</l>
<l>What happened to your child --.</l>
<l>They say you sent her away. You never sent her anywhere, did you...</l>
<l>She's hurting people. She's hurting people because she's been hurt. She's hurting me, my son, it has to stop --.</l>
<l>Where is she... please --.</l>
<l>Mr. Morgen, please help me --.</l>
<l>WAIT, NO!</l>
<l>They... they had a child...</l>
<l>I think he killed her.</l>
<l>We have to know what happened... she wants us to know what happened...</l>
<l>We have to know what happened...</l>
<l>Not anymore.</l>
<l>He kept her here... Her mother was going crazy. Morgan blamed the child. So he kept her here. Alone.</l>
<l>What if she couldn't control it? Making pictures? Sending pictures?</l>
<l>Who says she meant to?</l>
<l>What if it's the only way she knew to communicate.</l>
<l>The phone.</l>
<l>It only rang for me.</l>
<l>You and Aidan, it didn't ring. Just me. At the cabin -- in the mountains, Shelter Mountain... oh my god...</l>
<l>I've seen this tree. I've seen it burning...</l>
<l>The cabins have only been there for fifteen years...</l>
<l>The sun came right through the leaves, lit them up like it was on fire, right at sunset... Right when I watched the tape.</l>
<l>Katie and her friends, they died at ten that night, all of them. They must have watched it at ten...</l>
<l>Noah, stop... Noah, wait...</l>
<l>NOAH!</l>
<l>Drop something.</l>
<l>How long until sunset?</l>
<l>Everything we've done has led us here. All she's showed us -- it's for a reason --.</l>
<l>If all she wants is us dead, I'm not waiting till sunset. She's a big girl now. She can kill me herself.</l>
<l>Noah, what do you see? Noah?!</l>
<l>Heavy... why is water so heavy...</l>
<l>Will you take care of him, Noah...</l>
<l>Without me...</l>
<l>Take me down...</l>
<l>I'm here, Samara... I'm listening...</l>
<l>I'm so sorry...</l>
<l>We're here...</l>
<l>Her own mother. She was that afraid... of her own child.</l>
<l>She was just a child...</l>
<l>Seven days.</l>
<l>You could survive for seven days.</l>
<l>I miss you.</l>
<l>Hi, A-Bear.</l>
<l>want you to promise me something. If there's ever anything you're feeling, that you think I won't want to hear, or won't understand... I want you to tell me. Because I'll always want to listen. Always.</l>
<l>For a long time, she was all alone. And it made her sad. And it made her angry. But it's all right now. She's not alone anymore. We know about her now... and now other people know --.</l>
<l>No... Aidan, what's wrong --.</l>
<l>Because we helped her --.</l>
<l>Aidan, what, it's all right --.</l>
<l>I'm with you, I'm here -- you're safe! She's all right now, she's sleeping -- like Katie, in your drawing -- see! She's sleeping!</l>
<l>Pick up the phone, Noah, pick up the phone...</l>
<l>Where are you, Noah...</l>
<l>PICK UP THE GODDAMNP HONE!</l>
<l>What did I do... what did I do...</l>
<l>STAY IN YOUR ROOM AND LOCK THE DOOR!</l>
<l>We heard you! We listened!</l>
<l>Wasn't that enough...</l>
<l>What do you WANT!</l>
<l>Why not me...</l>
<l>What did I do that he didn't...</l>
<l>You and me.</l>
