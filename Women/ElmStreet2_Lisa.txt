<l>Hi.</l>
<l>How come?</l>
<l>Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?</l>
<l>I only know him a few weeks, Kerry.</l>
<l>That's okay, I wanted to.</l>
<l>That's okay, I wanted to.</l>
<l>Let me look at your eye...</l>
<l>You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.</l>
<l>You mean a shithead.</l>
<l>Okay... thanks.</l>
<l>Jesse, hi...</l>
<l>Oh... that's okay. Sorry you can't make it.</l>
<l>No, I understand. Parents can be real pains... I'll see you in the morning, then...</l>
<l>I told her you invited me over. I guess I should have called, huh?</l>
<l>I know.</l>
<l>I figured you might like some help.</l>
<l>Where does this go?</l>
<l>What's this?</l>
<l>Hey, this thing is five years old.</l>
<l>Uh-uh. Before my time.</l>
<l>I think it's sad...</l>
<l>Traumas of a ten-year old.</l>
<l>Wow, listen to this!</l>
<l>What is it?</l>
<l>Wow...</l>
<l>Are you okay.</l>
<l>No... thanks. I better get back.</l>
<l>Got a major paper due the end of this week.</l>
<l>World History.</l>
<l>But, I'll see you in the morning, right?</l>
<l>Hot stuff. Let me know how it turns out.</l>
<l>This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was?</l>
<l>Who?</l>
<l>Maybe you were having a premonition or something. You know, like those guys who help the police solve crimes and find missing people. You ever had anything like this happen before?</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>Can I look at that diary for a little while?</l>
<l>Thanks.</l>
<l>Hi, Kerry.</l>
<l>All of them.</l>
<l>Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.</l>
<l>Last party I had, Dad insisted on playing nothing but Benny Goodman records all night.</l>
<l>I'll see you later, okay?</l>
<l>I just got here myself. Went to the Public Library.</l>
<l>Research.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>C'mon, let's go for a ride.</l>
<l>I'm convinced you've had a genuine psychic vision.</l>
<l>At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before. But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and never do. It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.</l>
<l>You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy.</l>
<l>Look, you got electricity in your body, right?</l>
<l>And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?</l>
<l>What about "essential energy" the soul. Does that go into the air too? You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?</l>
<l>It's a surprise.</l>
<l>Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room? Fred Krueger worked here. It's an old powerplant - a steam generator!</l>
<l>Here.</l>
<l>I did some reading up on our friend, Fred Krueger.</l>
<l>He kidnapped twenty kids and brought them all here to die.</l>
<l>So, you feeling anything?</l>
<l>I thought you might be able to make a connection.</l>
<l>C'mon, cut it out.</l>
<l>I don't know. Concentrate or something.</l>
<l>Shhh. Just concentrate.</l>
<l>Anything?</l>
<l>About what?</l>
<l>I'll get over it.</l>
<l>You are sensitive. I mean you sensed that the rat was there. And I can feel something about you. Sometimes I feel like I know what you're thinking.</l>
<l>Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?</l>
<l>Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course.</l>
<l>Ghostbusters are fearless.</l>
<l>What is it - What's wrong?</l>
<l>What is it?</l>
<l>Oh, Jesse...</l>
<l>Jesse, this is no good. You've got to get some sleep, Jesse. You've got to get some sleep.</l>
<l>Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?</l>
<l>you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?</l>
<l>You want to talk about it?</l>
<l>You should eat something - you'll feel better.</l>
<l>I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together.</l>
<l>What's that?</l>
<l>You're going out?</l>
<l>Thanks, Mom.</l>
<l>Twelve-thirty. I promise.</l>
<l>Goodnight, Daddy.</l>
<l>Jesse?</l>
<l>Why won't you talk to me?</l>
<l>You're not being fair to me. I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.</l>
<l>It's okay, Jesse.</l>
<l>We'll figure it out together. We'll stay up all night if we have to. I won't let anything happen to you.</l>
<l>What's wrong?</l>
<l>He won't talk to me.</l>
<l>I shoud go see him, but...I don't know, the party and all...</l>
<l>Thanks, Patty. You're a pal.</l>
<l>Jesse, God - what happened?</l>
<l>Oh, Christ, you're hurt...</l>
<l>Who, Jesse?</l>
<l>Who? Who's doing this to you?</l>
<l>No, Jesse. This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.</l>
<l>I'm not gonna let anyone take you from me. There's got to be a reason. We'll figure it out together.</l>
<l>Wait a minute!</l>
<l>Wait in here for me. I'll be right back.</l>
<l>Something Nancy said - her last entry.</l>
<l>She wasn't crazy. All this really happened.</l>
<l>You can fight him.</l>
<l>Remember what I said? About good energy and bad energy? He thrives on bad energy. Hate, anger, fear. He is bad energy.</l>
<l>You've been afraid of him.</l>
<l>Fight it, Jesse!</l>
<l>You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear. Fight him, Jesse!</l>
<l>You're not afraid of him! He doesn't even exist.</l>
<l>Jesse!</l>
<l>Jesse, help!</l>
<l>Please, God...</l>
<l>He couldn't do it, Momma.</l>
<l>Please work, please.</l>
<l>Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!</l>
<l>Jesse!</l>
<l>Where's Jesse?</l>
<l>I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!</l>
<l>I love you, Jesse!</l>
<l>I'm not afraid of you. You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back. I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!</l>
<l>Come back to me, Jesse.</l>
<l>I love you, Jesse. Come back to me.</l>
<l>He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
