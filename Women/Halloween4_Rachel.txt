<l>Kido. It's four in the morning.</l>
<l>What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?</l>
<l>Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.</l>
<l>Jamie, sometimes it's...</l>
<l>We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.</l>
<l>I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.</l>
<l>Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn't know that.</l>
<l>Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday.</l>
<l>Sleep tight. We'll have French toast for breakfast, okay? Come on Sunday. Night night.</l>
<l>Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?</l>
<l>Mom, please.</l>
<l>Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.</l>
<l>Can't you find somebody else?</l>
<l>What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.</l>
<l>Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment. But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.</l>
<l>Oh...</l>
<l>Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.</l>
<l>Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.</l>
<l>It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?</l>
<l>How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?</l>
<l>Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.</l>
<l>Jamie!</l>
<l>Jamie, are you okay?</l>
<l>You remember Lindsay don't you?</l>
<l>You ready for some Ice Cream?</l>
<l>But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.</l>
<l>No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.</l>
<l>I don't want to look pushy.</l>
<l>Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.</l>
<l>Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>Jamie.</l>
<l>You bet.</l>
<l>Call me.</l>
<l>Jamie needs a Halloween costume.</l>
<l>In a second.</l>
<l>We need to talk.</l>
<l>Its about tonight.</l>
<l>My parents' baby-sitter canceled.</l>
<l>So I have to watch Jamie tonight.</l>
<l>Don't get angry.</l>
<l>My parents are going to come home early tonight.</l>
<l>I don't know Brady.</l>
<l>Jamie, what happened?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>You're okay. You probably saw a mask and it scared you. At least you're not cut. Come on, let's go home.</l>
<l>She'll be fine.</l>
<l>Here I am.</l>
<l>You guys always look great.</l>
<l>I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.</l>
<l>You're gonna be late. You don't want to blow your promotion.</l>
<l>Good luck, Dad.</l>
<l>Yeah, hurry up.</l>
<l>Is Brady there?</l>
<l>He's not back from work yet?</l>
<l>Okay...Well when he comes in could you tell him to drop by at about eight. I should be home by then.</l>
<l>This is Rachel. Okay, bye.</l>
<l>Come on Jamie, your gonna miss all the good Candy.</l>
<l>Come on Jamie.</l>
<l>Coming.</l>
<l>I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.</l>
<l>Jamie, wait for me.</l>
<l>Thank you.</l>

<l>Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.</l>
<l>Go ahead.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>

<l>Just leave me alone and lets forget it.</l>
