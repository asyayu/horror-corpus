<l>...Got it and I believe it. This is Stretch keeping the dedication line open on K-OKLA in Burkburnett... Here on the tip-top of the Dallas Ft. Worth metroplex...</l>
<l>You mean "We're on the Road to Nowhere?"</l>
<l>OK that's real funny guys. Wanna hang up now? You're tying up the line... Hey c'mon...</l>
<l>Yah, later sports. Just hang up OK?</l>
<l>Ya hear this, L.G.? Can't you cut these jerks off?</l>
<l>Wuh, they're off. How'd you do it L.G.?</l>
<l>You need a witness. I'm a witness.</l>
<l>This Porsche, it wasn't an accident. I was talking to the kids when it happened. These new stories make it like you're nuts; but you're not nuts, Mister --.</l>
<l>No. But I heard it --.</l>
<l>No listen: it's here on tape. Regulations. We gotta record all the calls. End of the night we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one it was so weird...</l>
<l>Here. It's right on here.</l>
<l>Evidence, sort of. Look: I'm a DJ on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett north of here. Got a nightly phone-in request show, and two nights ago these boys tied up my line with their car-phone and right in my own ears I heard something terrible happen. I didn't know what I'd heard, then I read your stories and I think what you're talking about is on this tape.</l>
<l>But this is real. You could use it to get people to believe you --.</l>
<l>Yeh but I am. Look at it this way: Destiny turned on the radio and tuned it right to my show...</l>
<l>I'm right in the middle of this story. Don'tcha see? I could break this story and do something real. I could help you...</l>
<l>But you can't do it alone --.</l>
<l>Right now? You wanna hear it --.</l>
<l>Hey, now wait mister --.</l>
<l>Yeh but it's, there's a lot of static, it's not clear what's going on. Anyway, I don't think it'd be legal to do this. FCC regulations --.</l>
<l>But why? Play the tape on-theair for what?</l>
<l>You got an awful lot of pride, Mister. Said you'd do this alone. What's changed that?</l>
<l>OK. But call me 'Stretch', Mister.</l>
<l>...so here's a special request we're doing tonight. You steady listeners know we're playing it every hour... This is for Lefty...</l>
<l>...this concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas. It's 12 midnight Central Standard Time...</l>
<l>Nope.</l>
<l>L.G., it was a request, right? It's in the logs as a request. People complain about requests every night. Right?</l>
<l>Nope.</l>
<l>'night, L.G.</l>
<l>No. We're closed. Off-the-air till tomorrow. Come back...</l>
<l>OK, a quick tour. But seriously quick and it ends at the Exit sign, OK?</l>
<l>Un-huh. These are the turntables...</l>
<l>Yeh. The storage room. We got no 'frig, but the ice works...</l>
<l>The record vault's full of oldies, I bet it's in there --</l>
<l>They live on fear, they live on fear...</l>
<l>How, how mad at me are you?... You're not really mad at me?...</l>
<l>How good are you, huh?...</l>
<l>How... good... are... you?...</l>
<l>Oh?... Really?...</l>
<l>Are you... really good?...</l>
<l>Really, really good?...</l>
<l>No, they'll get away. They can't...</l>
<l>Oh God, damnit Lefty you're late.</l>
<l>Uh-oh...</l>
<l>Urm. No I don't chew gum. Bad for your teeth.</l>
<l>Ahm... Listen: thanks for the gum... but... I gotta go home now. Y'know? Can't just hang out all night...</l>
<l>No. No! Put that down! No: what is that?! Is that wet? Is that wet?! Put it down! No --.</l>
<l>You're pissed off?? What about me? Listen: this isn't going to work. I'm trying to be open with you. It's nobody's fault. I just can't do this. Lemme go...</l>
<l>Lefty...</l>
<l>Lefty: it's me!</l>
<l>Lefty?...</l>
<l>Lefty... It's you, Lefty?...</l>
<l>Come on Lefty...</l>
<l>Pray for my soul, pray for my soul, pray for my soul...</l>
<d>(pause).</d>
