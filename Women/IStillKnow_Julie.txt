<l>I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they... well they're not around anymore. You see I... I...</l>
<l>I killed a man. Well, I thought I had... then...</l>
<l>You've got to understand... It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't.</l>
<l>I have these dreams... horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me.</l>
<l>You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't... gotten away with it.</l>
<l>I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt... to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis...</l>
<l>You know? But how could you...</l>
<l>I'm sorry --.</l>
<l>I'm fine.</l>
<l>I'm fine.</l>
<l>I had another dream, Will.</l>
<l>It was in a church... it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.</l>
<l>I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.</l>
<l>It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.</l>
<l>It was one year ago...</l>
<l>I'm trying. I really am... Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.</l>
<l>Right. Now I remember.</l>
<l>Are you getting out of town on the fourth?</l>
<l>Are you sure?</l>
<l>Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.</l>
<l>Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.</l>
<l>Ray, we're just friend.</l>
<l>Why are you being like this?</l>
<l>Ray, I can't...</l>
<l>I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...</l>
<l>It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.</l>
<l>It just isn't.</l>
<l>Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And... there's a million things to do.</l>
<l>Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.</l>
<l>Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just scared... that's all.</l>
<l>Okay. Okay. Face your fears...</l>
<l>There's nothing...</l>
<l>Okay, calm down, imagination.</l>
<l>I can't take this anymore. I can't.</l>
<l>Let's just do it.</l>
<l>What are you doing in my closet?</l>
<l>What are you doing in my closet?</l>
<l>That was heart attack time, Karla.</l>
<l>I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.</l>
<l>I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.</l>
<l>There's nothing between Will and me.</l>
<l>No I'm not.</l>
<l>Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --.</l>
<l>Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Ben...</l>
<l>That could break the machine.</l>
<l>The number's unlisted...</l>
<l>Okay, okay. You're right.</l>
<l>...South America... Carnival...</l>
<l>Magic 96.7!</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --.</l>
<l>It's okay.</l>
<l>Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.</l>
<l>We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...</l>
<l>You know...</l>
<l>It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free!</l>
<l>Ray, come on. I want us to be together.</l>
<l>Will you try... for me, please?</l>
<l>Ray... please try. I really miss you.</l>
<l>Okay. Bye.</l>
<l>He's not coming. I thought he was just...</l>
<l>But, he said he'd try.</l>
<l>He does work hard.</l>
<l>Then, don't.</l>
<l>Oh!</l>
<l>You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas!</l>
<l>Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.</l>
<l>Deep breaths --.</l>
<l>You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.</l>
<l>I'm the King of the World.</l>
<l>I will, and you remind me of the same thing.</l>
<l>It's pretty remote here.</l>
<l>Where is everyone? I'll ask --.</l>
<l>It sure is a beautiful old hotel.</l>
<l>Your what?</l>
<l>We haven't exchanged anything.</l>
<l>Storm season?</l>
<l>It beats being on the mainland.</l>
<l>Why's that?</l>
<l>Karla! You promised.</l>
<l>Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.</l>
<l>Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --./l>
<l>I miss Ray... I tried to call him.</l>
<l>I'm Julie. This is Karla.</l>
<l>I'll drink to that!</l>
<l>Don't even think about it.</l>
<l>No way.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Not me... no way...</l>
<l>You asked for it.</l>
<l>Song number thirty-nine.</l>
<l>And I still know... what you did... last summer...</l>
<l>It's... him.</l>
<l>He did something to the screen... it, it, said...</l>
<l>Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...</l>
<l>There's no way... just stop it right now...</l>
<l>Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.</l>
<l>Oh, Will! I'm sorry.</l>
<l>No, no, no. This was really sweet...</l>
<l>No -- it's not that. It's... I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.</l>
<l>Are you sure? I really appreciate it.</l>
<l>Will...?</l>
<l>Will?</l>
<l>Is that you?</l>
<l>It's happening again! There's a body!</l>
<l>It's in my room!</l>
<l>There was a body! I swear it!</l>
<l>I wasn't dreaming.</l>
<l>Listen to me. He's here.</l>
<l>I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.</l>
<l>The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.</l>
<l>I want off this island.</l>
<l>Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.</l>
<l>It's dead.</l>
<l>Some.</l>
<l>It's okay... He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.</l>
<l>Nice move.</l>
<l>Cancer in a box.</l>
<l>Houseplant.</l>
<l>Karla!</l>
<l>You say something?</l>
<l>Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny.</l>
<l>I'm not crazy... I'm not crazy. He's here...</l>
<l>We've got to get to the radio and call for help.</l>
<l>We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.</l>
<l>Ben Willis.</l>
<l>They never found the body.</l>
<l>Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen. ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up --.</l>
<l>I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job.</l>
<l>It's not him.</l>
<l>Voodoo.</l>
<l>Leave him alone.</l>
<l>Let him go. I believe him.</l>
<l>He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't.</l>
<l>Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right... This whole thing was a setup.</l>
<l>Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>How do we know you're not?</l>
<l>We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.</l>
<l>Did he do it?</l>
<l>I've got to see.</l>
<l>I'm not dying on this island, Will.</l>
<l>Do you hear me?</l>
<l>You want me, Ben Willis? Come and get me. I'm right here.</l>
<l>My grave stays empty!</l>
<l>Then, we fight --.</l>
<l>I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault.</l>
<l>Wait, it's Nancy --.</l>
<l>Get used to it.</l>
<l>There's no way to lock it.</l>
<l>You sick freak.</l>
<l>Karla!</l>
<l>He's inside.</l>
<l>Come on...</l>
<l>Nancy...</l>
<l>No way!!</l>
<l>Move!</l>
<l>Come on, gimme a shot --.</l>
<l>Come on, you can make it.</l>
<l>I'm right here. Grab my hand.</l>
<l>Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand.</l>
<l>No, you're not.</l>
<l>All right --.</l>
<l>Did you get help?</l>
<l>What happened?</l>
<l>He's in it with Willis?</l>
<l>Your stomach, you're hurt --.</l>
<l>Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death.</l>
<l>We need a first-aid kit.</l>
<l>Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up.</l>
<l>You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound.</l>
<l>Why are you doing this to me?</l>
<l>I trusted you.</l>
<l>...Why?</l>
<l>OMIGOD --.</l>
<l>No, no, no --.</l>
<l>Just... Die.</l>
<l>You're okay. Thank god.</l>
<l>We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret.</l>
<l>Ray... what are you doing?</l>
<l>Never do that again.</l>
<l>I love it here.</l>
<l>You know me to well.</l>
<l>What is my problem?</l>
