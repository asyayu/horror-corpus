<l>What's up?</l>
<l>Thanks, I'm going out actually.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Yeah me too.</l>
<l>I see you.</l>
<l>Don't you have a video game to play or an animal to torture?</l>
<l>What are you reading?</l>
<l>Is it good?</l>
<l>Hey Paul.</l>
<l>You ever play the "trade game"?</l>
<l>It's a people watching game. My sister and I used to play it when we were bored.</l>
<l>No. Shut up. Let me finish.</l>
<l>OK. You start by watching the crowd - casually scope out the people around us.</l>
<l>Now without telling me, pick one person that you'd like to trade places with. It could be anybody. For whatever reason.</l>
<l>So now I get 2 guesses to figure out who you picked and why you want to trade places with 'em.</l>
<l>Him.</l>
<l>You could pick up cars and throw them if you were that guy.</l>
<l>That guy.</l>
<l>I figured you'd wanna sleep with the hot blonde.</l>
<l>Ok. Who was your trade?</l>
<l>The dad?</l>
<l>Come on. It's not like you're an old man. You're 21.</l>
<l>Yes, he's probably taking a shit right now.</l>
<l>Ok. My turn.</l>
<l>I got mine.</l>
<l>Where?</l>
<l>Uh... I don't see her.</l>
<l>Are you teasing me?</l>
<l>Hugh, I'm sorry I just don't know who you're talking about, but that's not who I picked...</l>
<l>No. What's wrong?</l>
<l>Why? What's going on?</l>
<l>Oh. Well we don't have to watch the movie. You need to go home?</l>
<l>Ok.</l>
<l>Did you see somebody that made you wanna leave?</l>
<l>Like an ex-girlfriend or something? You said there was a girl in a yellow dress. Was it someone you knew?</l>
<l>Ok.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Bye.</l>
<l>Mom knows you smoke.</l>
<l>Or she'll steal your cigarettes.</l>
<l>Good. Mostly. He was acting kind of weird last night.</l>
<l>I don't know. He said he wasn't feeling good, but it seemed like something was on his mind.</l>
<l>No. I know he wants to... but last night... he seemed different.</l>
<l>He's not. I mean, I don't know for a fact, but... no.</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>You're still... ?</l>
<l>You haven't... ?</l>
<l>Whenever.</l>
<l>What about Paul?</l>
<l>It'd be like fucking my step-brother.</l>
<l>You smell like cherry coke, banana nicotine.</l>
<l>Mom's gonna love it.</l>
<l>It's weird still being here. It’s like... everybody else went away to school, but me.</l>
<l>I'm not sure I even want to. It's all kind of useless isn't it? I mean, degrees don't get people jobs. At least not good ones. Look at mom.</l>
<l>She won't let me stay here if I don't.</l>
<l>Ok. I'll visit.</l>
<l>Where are you leading me?</l>
<l>The bottom feels gross.</l>
<l>I want to.</l>
<l>You like me?</l>
<l>What? Nobody's here.</l>
<l>Let's go to the car.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>It's funny, I used to daydream about being old enough to go on dates and drive around with friends in their cars.</l>
<l>I had this image of myself holding hands with a really cute guy, listening to music on the radio and driving along a pretty road... maybe somewhere up north... after the trees started to change color.</l>
<l>It was never about going anywhere... just having some kind of freedom I guess. Now we're old enough, but where the hell do we go right?</l>
<l>Whuuuttt aarrhhh youuhhh doingggggg?</l>
<l>Hellllppppppp.</l>
<l>Whhhoooo isss??</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Whooo isszzz atttehh?</l>
<l>Whudddda fucckk d'youu wannnttt???</l>
<l>Ehhhhh. Noooo...</l>
<l>Huuughhhhh!</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Not inside, but I know where it is. I waited in the car for him once. He didn't want me to come in. He said he was embarrassed about where he lived.</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>I need to talk to my sister.</l>
<l>Uh huh.</l>
<l>Ok.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Thank you.</l>
<l>There was an old woman at school today. She was staring at me... it seemed like she was following me.</l>
<l>No, but she freaked me out. I didn't even go back to class.</l>
<l>Hugh told me that he passed it onto me. That something was gonna follow me.</l>
<l>Yeah, I know.</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Maybe on the couch.</l>
<l>Just keep your door locked.</l>
<l>Did she say anything?</l>
<l>I keep thinking that something must be wrong with me. Even right now, it feels like I'm ten feet away from myself. The walls seem far away. I don't even like looking across the room. I feel... overwhelmed.</l>
<l>Will it go away?</l>
<l>I can't sleep - not in there.</l>
<l>There's a reason for that.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>I don't know. I think we just grew apart, right? Or you and Kelly got close. It's not a big deal, is it?</l>
<l>You were my first kiss, you know.</l>
<l>Was I not yours?</l>
<l>And you kissed Kelly. She told me. You kissed two sisters... that's kind of gross.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Ridiculous.</l>
<l>We had no idea how terrible it was.</l>
<l>She scooped them up so fast. Called my mom too. Me and Kelly got a sex ed lecture the next day.</l>
<l>Go look.</l>
<l>Are you sure? You looked around?</l>
<l>We should call the police.</l>
<l>OK.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>It's in the house.</l>
<l>I saw it.</l>
<l>It's in the kitchen.</l>
<l>Get in here.</l>
<l>I need water. Oh my god I need some water.</l>
<l>No. Stay here.</l>
<l>Is something wrong with me?</l>
<l>Yeah, but I saw a girl in the kitchen.</l>
<l>You don't believe me.</l>
<l>Don't open the door.</l>
<l>I'm really scared, Kel.</l>
<l>You can't tell mom. She'll freak out and she won't believe me.</l>
<l>Do you see that?</l>
<l>Greg?</l>
<l>I don't want to go home.</l>
<l>I need to find him.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Are you leaving?</l>
<l>He told me never to go into a room that didn't have more than one way out.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Lawson High School.</l>
<l>His real name's Jeff.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Hi. Um. Is Jeff here?</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>That'd be great.</l>
<l>Hey.</l>
<l>I'm not sure yet.</l>
<l>I just want to know what's going on.</l>
<l>I would never sleep with him again.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>I don’t know.</l>
<l>Hello, yes, um, this is Mrs. Height. I’m calling to let you know that my daughter Kelly is sick with the flu and she’s gonna be out for a few days - uh maybe longer.</l>
<l>It's a bit lonely.</l>
<l>I feel safe out here.</l>
<l>I wonder how long it'll take before it gets here.</l>
<l>Hey.</l>
<l>Um... I don't know.</l>
<l>No, Paul.</l>
<l>I know.</l>
<l>Oh... um... Paul, I...</l>
<l>No. You go ahead.</l>
<l>Eh.</l>
<l>Maybe in a little bit.</l>
<l>Help me!</l>
<l>Greg, it's outside!</l>
<l>It's trying to get in!</l>
<l>Yes there is!</l>
<l>Greg?</l>
<l>Greg, are you ok?</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Helloooo?</l>
<l>Kelly?</l>
<l>Is it really you?!</l>
<l>Ok.</l>
<l>Does mom know?</l>
<l>How long am I gonna be here?</l>
<l>It's gonna come here. What am I gonna do?</l>
<l>How far are we from the lake house?</l>
<l>No! Get her away from me! Can you see her?! She's right there!</l>
<l>I don't want anything.</l>
<l>It's gonna catch me.</l>
<l>It'll be here soon...</l>
<l>You haven't seen it?</l>
<l>Really?</l>
<l>You believe me right? You're not just playing along?</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>I'm sorry about your car.</l>
<l>Kelly!? Mom!?</l>
<l>Get out of here!!</l>
<l>Greg! Open the door! Greg!</l>
<l>Greg! It's in the house!</l>
<l>Greg! Watch out!</l>
<l>Greg, it's outside your...!</l>
<l>Who is it?</l>
<l>Hang on.</l>
<l>It's gonna be here sooner or later.</l>
<l>I shouldn't have.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>I thought he would be ok.</l>
<l>He wasn't scared.</l>
<l>We slept together in high school. It wasn't a big deal.</l>
<l>Do you?</l>
<l>Yeah?</l>
<l>My parents said the same thing to me.</l>
<l>I don't know. Hours I bet.</l>
<l>Is that how you remember it?</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>It just walked into the room. It's right there.</l>
<l>Right there!</l>
<l>I don’t wanna tell you.</l>
<l>No. It’s just standing there - looking at me.</l>
<l>It’s moving.</l>
<l>Walking. Walking closer.</l>
<l>Paul, I wanna get out.</l>
<l>No, I don’t wanna do this. I just wanna get out of the water.</l>
<l>Help!</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>You missed it!</l>
<l>Watch out! Don't get too close.</l>
<l>It's there!</l>
<l>No! It... missed!</l>
<l>No! Right there!</l>
<l>I feel like I’m hurting you.</l>
<l>Do you?</l>
