<l>Maybe you should give it some time.</l>
<l>She's not like Mom. She's ... I don't know ... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.</l>
<l>I don't know her. She's so ... sealed up.</l>
<l>Really?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Sure.</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>Julia!</l>

<l>Where the hell did you come from?</l>
<l>It's just a puzzle box.</l>
<l>Who are you?</l>
<l>Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.</l>
<l>This isn't for real.</l>
<l>Don't touch me!</l>
<l>Steve. Thank God you came.</l>
<l>These THINGS ... they want to take me --.</l>

<l>To a man called Frank Cotton?</l>
<l>But he escaped you.</l>
<l>HE did. I've seen him. He's alive.</l>
<l>I'll take you to him. Then you take him instead of me. Back wherever you come from.</l>
<l>Please! Dad! It's me! It's Kirsty!</l>
<l>Please, answer me! Please --.</l>
