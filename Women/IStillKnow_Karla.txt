<l>I thought you were out of town!</l>
<l>I thought you were out of town!</l>
<l>I just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!</l>
<l>No. When I put these skinny pants on my body... Now, that's heart attack time.</l>
<l>And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me.</l>
<l>Yeah, right -- whatever.</l>
<l>Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so... Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.</l>
<l>What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me.</l>
<l>Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.</l>
<l>I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.</l>
<l>If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.</l>
<l>Ask her to dance.</l>
<l>Go on.</l>
<l>Say yes.</l>
<l>No means yes.</l>
<l>Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.</l>
<l>Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin' fine.</l>
<l>Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.</l>
<l>Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.</l>
<l>It's Tyrell.</l>
<l>Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.</l>
<l>I know it, and it feels good.</l>
<l>Hi, Ty.</l>
<l>Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.</l>
<l>Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.</l>
<l>Well, I'm in school and --.</l>
<l>Yes!</l>
<l>Brazil? Um...</l>
<l>You don't know?! You have to know. You know everything...</l>
<l>Still here...thinking...</l>
<l>Five... Four...</l>
<l>Rio de Janeiro!</l>
<l>No. Yes?</l>
<l>Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</l>
<l>Magic 96.7!</l>
<l>I won. I won... I won, I won, I won.</l>
<l>Now, let's see... There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins.</l>
<l>Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date.</l>
<l>You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?.</l>
<l>That boy has got fish on the brain.</l>
<l>Hey, cheer up, Charlie.</l>
<l>We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah...</l>
<l>Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.</l>
<l>Julie, you left four messages... Four.</l>
<l>He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!</l>
<l>Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.</l>
<l>And I don't want to have to say I told you so...</l>
<l>Hey, sorry...</l>
<l>He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.</l>
<l>I said we start having fun. And that means now.</l>
<l>We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama Mama. We goin' Bahamas...</l>
<l>Honey, some folks just can't fly.</l>
<l>No, I'm the King of the World.</l>
<l>Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.</l>
<l>Check it out.</l>
<l>Take a bath, maybe.</l>
<l>Hello? Hello?</l>
<l>Checking in... Karla Wilson.</l>
<l>Oh, what?</l>
<l>Is that bad?</l>
<l>Julie, we're talkin' suites!</l>
<l>That'll be just fine with us.</l>
<l>Wait... Did you say off-season?</l>
<l>Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.</l>
<l>I wanted you all to have a good trip.</l>
<l>Oooh, the mainland --.</l>
<l>Rio, baby!</l>
<l>Their stuff in there...</l>
<l>...and ours in here.</l>
<l>Promised me what, baby?</l>
<l>I made all my promises to William.</l>
<l>He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...</l>
<l>But...</l>
<l>Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours.</l>
<l>For the next foury-eight hours...</l>
<l>Your smile is a frown...turned upside down.</l>
<l>They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.</l>
<l>Am I right, sister?</l>
<l>To a great weekend --.</l>
<l>I'll drink to that!</l>
<l>So what do you do around here for fun?</l>
<l>Karaoke -- perfect.</l>
<l>Okay, I won't.</l>
<l>Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it.</l>
<l>Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.</l>
<l>Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!</l>
<l>Julie...</l>
<l>Tha's it.</l>
<l>I've decided.</l>
<l>I'm changing my major to finance.</l>
<l>And going to Wall Street.</l>
<l>'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.</l>
<l>Jacuzzi.</l>
<l>I spent a hundred bucks on it... even if it's just so you can pull it off.</l>
<l>You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?</l>
<l>Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.</l>
<l>Don't you get feisty...</l>
<l>I used to be a lifeguard... I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.</l>
<l>Ty!</l>
<l>How's Julie?</l>
<l>You're not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'.</l>
<l>Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?</l>
<l>What about a radio?</l>
<l>What the hell would you call this?</l>
<l>You get any sleep at all?</l>
<l>Hey --.</l>
<l>Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?</l>
<l>I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.</l>
<l>Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you.</l>
<l>No, this is the safe sun.</l>
<l>It's better than a day at the beach.</l>
<l>Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new --.</l>
<l>Exactly.</l>
<l>Set to three seventy-five, bake for one hour...</l>
<l>Just kidding.</l>
<l>Damn. How many pairs you got in there?</l>
<l>Julie!</l>
<l>I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.</l>
<l>We gotta get out of here. Now.</l>
<l>There were boats here? Refresh my memory, there were boats...</l>
<l>Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.</l>
<l>Julie...</l>
<l>Julie, we have to do something.</l>
<l>Julie, where are you going?</l>
<l>Come on, Julie. You saw his room.</l>
<l>What do you mean?</l>
<l>I know I don't want to stay in here.</l>
<l>Be careful, Julie.</l>
<l>...Today's July fourth.</l>
<l>Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.</l>
<l>Why? He can't help us.</l>
<l>Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.</l>
<l>Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?</l>
<l>I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.</l>
<l>It's too late for that.</l>
<l>You think that's a good place to hide?</l>
<l>Ty!</l>
<l>What do we do?</l>
<l>Oh, god, no --.</l>
<l>Oww...</l>
<l>It's locked!</l>
<l>Please! Hurry!</l>
<l>Hurry!</l>
<l>Come on!!</l>
<l>Julie, come on.</l>
<l>I don't know...</l>
<l>Julie?</l>
<l>I'm holding your hand!</l>
<l>...Nancy?</l>
<l>Help's here. Help's here.</l>
<l>Come on, come on.</l>
<l>Damn you.</l>
<l>Oh, god, it's you --.</l>
<l>Is he?</l>
<l>You know, it's true what they say about package vacations... You get what you pay for.</l>
