Twenty... Nineteen... Eighteen...
Ten-nine-eight-seven...
Relax, nobody is coming back.
Seriously. How hot do I look?
Not as much as Money does.
No?
Okay okay, my turn...
Would you ever -- lose three fingers from each hand? Like, all you'd have left would be these scary little nubs.
What about you, Alex?
I'd consider it.
Guess it depends on whether I'd have to swallow, or not.
And soon, Money and I will be out of here too. We keep hitting houses like today's --.
-- and hola, California.
What? He's living here now?
'kay then give me money.
What?
Yeah. Just got it.
A butterfly. But its wings haven't grown out, yet.
Forget it, it's stupid.
When my dad left us, my mom started using, made her into venom. Said dad leavin' was my fault, everything was fine 'til I was born.
I missed him, used to cry and cry for hours. One day my mom got so fed up, she locked me up in the trunk of a car that was hitched to the back of the trailer.
She'd keep me in there for hours, even days.
There was this tiny little hole in the trunk. This butterfly would fly in, it actually kept me company. Made me feel safe. I'd close my eyes, and imagine myself as this purple butterfly, that'd fly away.
When I leave this city I'll finish this tat, ink its wings, that'll be the last time I ever mark my body.
Why don't you come with us to LA? It'll be sad without you.
Bring him. Can you imagine the kind of trouble you and I can get into in Hollywood? What if I get 'discovered'? How crazy would it be to see this face, in a movie?
You think the money's in the house?
We won't get caught. Not if we do this right.
He'd kinda right. We got this heisting down to a science. If we're lucky, this will be the last house we'll ever rob.
Cool.
Where?
For real?
That's amazing. Wow. I promise Alex, you won't regret this.
This is gonna be cake.
We've done sleepers before. No big deal.
Oh my God. What the --.
Let's get outta here. Now.
Kind of fucked up to rob a blind guy, is't it?
How do you know?
You got four keys with you?
And why have locks that can only be opened from the inside?
What's it do?
Where's the master keypad?
What about that?
You calling me fat?
Remember this? The "loco shoulder"? You tried to kiss me in second grade.
I was so freaked out, I kicked you in the nuts, then you shoved me off the top of the jungle gym. When I hit the ground and my shoulder popped out. Like so --.
It hurts but trust me, I can fit through that hole.
Then I'll kick him in the nuts, too.
I need you two to pull my shoulder. Really fast and really hard.
Pull.
SHIT...
Ok get me up there.
Oh my God. It reeks in here.
I can't breathe. So nasty in here.
Motherfucker.
Oh shit...
Ok, ok here we go. Twenty, nineteen, eighteen...
...seventeen, sixteen, fifteen.
...fourteen, thirteen, twelve.
...eleven, ten. Where are you?
...seven, six, five.
...three, two.
...shit.
Oh thank God...
What da...
AH!!
Guy is gassed and out. In Sleeping Beauty mode.
Heard what? My heart about to explode out my chest?
A safe.
Now what?
You've never fired a gun before.
We are so close to getting what we came for.
Alex... wait.
I found the money.
Well it's our millions, now.
Want us to go to jail? Once the cops realize we used your dad's codes and keys for every heist we've pulled they'll arrest him too. That's what you want?
It's just us, now. You and me. So let's just find a way out.
It's a basement.
We have to hurry.
Which way?
What is this? Where do we go?
Is this a dead end?
Right or left?
Maybe you got disoriented...
We have to turn around.
Alex?
Let's get the fuck out of here please...
Oh my God!
Who are you?
This is why he killed Money... he thought we knew about her.
What's with the mask?
A helmet?
What's your name?
We need to help her.
And leave her down here?!
How long do you think before that maniac finds out we're here? By the time the cops arrive, she's gonna be dead.
The hand cuffs...
No.
You can do this.
No!
No... no...
ALEX?!!
Alex?! You're okay.
No. I don't want to go back into that house.
Okay, okay --.
Come on... Try the keays.
Oh God no...
Oh God.
Cindy... she was the girl locked in the cellar. She killed his daughter.
What are you doing?
I can't go to jail.
Look.
Fuck. Fuck.
Come on, come on...
HAAAAARG!
Arrrrrrrggggggh.
God. Help me?! Fucking help me!
Yes! Please!
Okay. I can do this.
Please stop!
What have you done to him...
Please. Let me go...
Yes you do. Look, I understand you... I really do. This girl killed your Emma...
Cindy should have gone to jail for that, but that didn't happen. So you lock her up down here. You wanted her to pay.
I know how you feel, but nothing you do to me will bring her back.
That's not true.
HELP!! PLEASE!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!
Please... God, please.
Please stop...
You can't do this to me...
No! NOOOOOOOOO!!!! PLEASE!!!
Don't... Don't...
You son of a bitch. Don't you dare touch me. Hear me motherfucker?!
No. I'm not leaving here without the money.
We need that money, Alex.
Where did he put the cash?
I'm not leaving here empty-handed, Alex. Okay?! Not after what he put me through.
Why did you come here, Alex?
You could have given us the alarm codes, and you would have gotten your share. You know that. So be honest, why did you come?
But WHY?
Then help me live past this nightmare, help me find the cash.
Doesn't matter. He's your dad, he'd never turn you in.
I'm yours, Alex. Let's take that backpack and leave here, forever. Buy a little house on the beach, spend the rest of our lives fucking each other's brains out.
Stop...
I said stop, you motherfucker...
STOP OR I SWEAR I KILL YOU RIGHT HERE! RIGHT NOW.
I'll only ask you once. Where's --.
Tell us where it is. Or I swear I'll torture you til you do.
Where is it?
You know what they do to men like you in prison? Soon as we leave town, we'll make sure the cops find you here. Won't be hard for them to figure out what you've done.
I'm not letting this freak off the hook.
We hit the road, sleep in cheap motels, drink expensive liquor, and finally be free.
We're gonna be fine.
You sick fuck!!! You can't get to me now! You're nothing out here! Nothing!
Oh God no...
Somebody help! Please! Heeeeelp!
Come on...
Alex...
I'm so sorry... This is all my fault.
No. No.
(thinks).
(a beat).
(she shakes it off).
(a beat).
(startled).
(whispers).
(sobs).
(eyeballs Cindy's corpse).
(she breaks down, weaker).Billy? What the...
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
..out at the airport...
Got it.
Have a good trip.
What are you doing here?
Now that it's out of your system.
Oh it did?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have little bump-bump.
Time to go, stud bucket.
You know what my dad will do to you?
I appreciate the romantic gesture.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Get outa here.
What happened?
No way.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
Sheriff Burke. Dewey.
Good.
How do you gut someone?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
It's past seven.
I'm not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Tatum?
Hi. Who is this?
I have no idea.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl - who can't act - who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!
Oh Billy... Please... God...
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
..yeah...
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Did you reach my Dad?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
Any word on my Dad?
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, Tatum.
My Dad?
It's alright. I'll get it.
Hello?
NOOOOOO...
LEAVE ME ALONE!
Who are you?
I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley.
It's never gonna stop. Is it?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
I'm not here to fight.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
Please. You owe me.
You owe my mother.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Do you still think he's innocent?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
No, Cotton murdered my mother.
No, it was Cotton.
I'm sorry I mangled your face.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
He promised me he'd be back.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
I bet he's pissed.
Why are they doing this?
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You know that's not true.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on.
Pathetic.
Is someone there?
He's here... I saw him... he's here...
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Are you serious?
I don't know...
Yeah, okay... whatever.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Oh, god...
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Who?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
TATUM!
Deal.
Yeah.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Have they found my father?
Should I be worried?
Billy? Jesus, you scared me.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I wanna let go. I do...
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
Yeah... I think so.
"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."
Who did you call?
When you're arrested - you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Uh-huh.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
BILLY WATCH OUT!!!!
DEWEY!
NOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME!
Stop. Right there.
Don't come any closer.
Stay away.
Fuck you both.
Please! God! Help me!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
GO AWAY LEAVE ME ALONE!
Oh God. Billy!
I thought you were...
He's out there.
NO! Don't believe him.
Stu... please... help me...
What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Daddy!
Why are you doing this?
Fuck you.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Why did you kill my mother?
I don't understand...
What?
Stop it!
You sick fucks -- you've seen one too many movies.
I like that ending.
Are you alone in the house?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Not this time.
This is for my Mom, asshole.
And this Billy stud-bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie.
Oh Daddy...
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
(whispering).
(quiet, almost to herself).
(into phone).
(eyes clock).
(into phone).
(playing along).
(correcting him).
(sharply).
(crying).
(giving in).
(surprising herself).
(to herself).
(at the door).
(fighting tears).
(from phone).
(aware).What's up?
Thanks, I'm going out actually.
Yeah.
Yeah me too.
I see you.
Don't you have a video game to play or an animal to torture?
What are you reading?
Is it good?
Hey Paul.
You ever play the "trade game"?
It's a people watching game. My sister and I used to play it when we were bored.
No. Shut up. Let me finish.
OK. You start by watching the crowd - casually scope out the people around us.
Now without telling me, pick one person that you'd like to trade places with. It could be anybody. For whatever reason.
So now I get 2 guesses to figure out who you picked and why you want to trade places with 'em.
Him.
You could pick up cars and throw them if you were that guy.
That guy.
I figured you'd wanna sleep with the hot blonde.
Ok. Who was your trade?
The dad?
Come on. It's not like you're an old man. You're 21.
Yes, he's probably taking a shit right now.
Ok. My turn.
I got mine.
Where?
Uh... I don't see her.
Are you teasing me?
Hugh, I'm sorry I just don't know who you're talking about, but that's not who I picked...
No. What's wrong?
Why? What's going on?
Oh. Well we don't have to watch the movie. You need to go home?
Ok.
Did you see somebody that made you wanna leave?
Like an ex-girlfriend or something? You said there was a girl in a yellow dress. Was it someone you knew?
Ok.
Yeah.
Bye.
Mom knows you smoke.
Or she'll steal your cigarettes.
Good. Mostly. He was acting kind of weird last night.
I don't know. He said he wasn't feeling good, but it seemed like something was on his mind.
No. I know he wants to... but last night... he seemed different.
He's not. I mean, I don't know for a fact, but... no.
I don't know.
Yeah.
You're still... ?
You haven't... ?
Whenever.
What about Paul?
It'd be like fucking my step-brother.
You smell like cherry coke, banana nicotine.
Mom's gonna love it.
It's weird still being here. It’s like... everybody else went away to school, but me.
I'm not sure I even want to. It's all kind of useless isn't it? I mean, degrees don't get people jobs. At least not good ones. Look at mom.
She won't let me stay here if I don't.
Ok. I'll visit.
Where are you leading me?
The bottom feels gross.
I want to.
You like me?
What? Nobody's here.
Let's go to the car.
Yeah.
It's funny, I used to daydream about being old enough to go on dates and drive around with friends in their cars.
I had this image of myself holding hands with a really cute guy, listening to music on the radio and driving along a pretty road... maybe somewhere up north... after the trees started to change color.
It was never about going anywhere... just having some kind of freedom I guess. Now we're old enough, but where the hell do we go right?
Whuuuttt aarrhhh youuhhh doingggggg?
Hellllppppppp.
Whhhoooo isss??
No.
Whooo isszzz atttehh?
Whudddda fucckk d'youu wannnttt???
Ehhhhh. Noooo...
Huuughhhhh!
Yeah.
No.
Not inside, but I know where it is. I waited in the car for him once. He didn't want me to come in. He said he was embarrassed about where he lived.
Hello?
I need to talk to my sister.
Uh huh.
Ok.
Yeah.
Thank you.
There was an old woman at school today. She was staring at me... it seemed like she was following me.
No, but she freaked me out. I didn't even go back to class.
Hugh told me that he passed it onto me. That something was gonna follow me.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know.
No.
No.
Maybe on the couch.
Just keep your door locked.
Did she say anything?
I keep thinking that something must be wrong with me. Even right now, it feels like I'm ten feet away from myself. The walls seem far away. I don't even like looking across the room. I feel... overwhelmed.
Will it go away?
I can't sleep - not in there.
There's a reason for that.
Yeah.
I don't know. I think we just grew apart, right? Or you and Kelly got close. It's not a big deal, is it?
You were my first kiss, you know.
Was I not yours?
And you kissed Kelly. She told me. You kissed two sisters... that's kind of gross.
Yes.
Ridiculous.
We had no idea how terrible it was.
She scooped them up so fast. Called my mom too. Me and Kelly got a sex ed lecture the next day.
Go look.
Are you sure? You looked around?
We should call the police.
OK.
Yeah.
It's in the house.
I saw it.
It's in the kitchen.
Get in here.
I need water. Oh my god I need some water.
No. Stay here.
Is something wrong with me?
Yeah, but I saw a girl in the kitchen.
You don't believe me.
Don't open the door.
I'm really scared, Kel.
You can't tell mom. She'll freak out and she won't believe me.
Do you see that?
Greg?
I don't want to go home.
I need to find him.
No.
Are you leaving?
He told me never to go into a room that didn't have more than one way out.
What?
Lawson High School.
His real name's Jeff.
No.
Hi. Um. Is Jeff here?
Yeah.
That'd be great.
Hey.
I'm not sure yet.
I just want to know what's going on.
I would never sleep with him again.
What?
I don’t know.
Hello, yes, um, this is Mrs. Height. I’m calling to let you know that my daughter Kelly is sick with the flu and she’s gonna be out for a few days - uh maybe longer.
It's a bit lonely.
I feel safe out here.
I wonder how long it'll take before it gets here.
Hey.
Um... I don't know.
No, Paul.
I know.
Oh... um... Paul, I...
No. You go ahead.
Eh.
Maybe in a little bit.
Help me!
Greg, it's outside!
It's trying to get in!
Yes there is!
Greg?
Greg, are you ok?
Hello?
Helloooo?
Kelly?
Is it really you?!
Ok.
Does mom know?
How long am I gonna be here?
It's gonna come here. What am I gonna do?
How far are we from the lake house?
No! Get her away from me! Can you see her?! She's right there!
I don't want anything.
It's gonna catch me.
It'll be here soon...
You haven't seen it?
Really?
You believe me right? You're not just playing along?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your car.
Kelly!? Mom!?
Get out of here!!
Greg! Open the door! Greg!
Greg! It's in the house!
Greg! Watch out!
Greg, it's outside your...!
Who is it?
Hang on.
It's gonna be here sooner or later.
I shouldn't have.
No.
I thought he would be ok.
He wasn't scared.
We slept together in high school. It wasn't a big deal.
Do you?
Yeah?
My parents said the same thing to me.
I don't know. Hours I bet.
Is that how you remember it?
Oh my God.
It just walked into the room. It's right there.
Right there!
I don’t wanna tell you.
No. It’s just standing there - looking at me.
It’s moving.
Walking. Walking closer.
Paul, I wanna get out.
No, I don’t wanna do this. I just wanna get out of the water.
Help!
Yeah.
You missed it!
Watch out! Don't get too close.
It's there!
No! It... missed!
No! Right there!
I feel like I’m hurting you.
Do you?
(smiling at the bunch).
(stern but loving).
(with a gasp).
(together).
(speaking to no one).
(whispers).
(whispers).
(almost to herself).
(whispers).
(whispers).
(into phone).
(beat).
(beat).
(still afraid).
(relieved).
(mumbling).
(whispers).
(whispers).
(running).
(beat).
(still staring out the window).
(quietly).I’ll never get used to this.
A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan.
What’s that?
Yeah, but I’ve never seen this before.
It’s a Buddhist ritual. The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace.
It’s not trivia. It’s what they believe. And it’s far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.
What?
Oh, crap --.
C’mon, you’re gonna be late.
Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck. And I might have a vested interest in those years.
Maybe.
I’ll call you when I get home.
I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I’m not scheduled to work today --.
Just a test to study for. Why?
What’s this phrase?
Hello? Mrs. Williams?
Is anyone here?
Oh my God... are you alright? --.
Okay, Emma. Let’s try again: my name is Karen. Do you remember? I’m from the Health Center. I’m substituting for Yoko, just for today.
Looks like you need a new Band-Aid. How’d this happen, Emma?
Would you like a bath? Maybe that will help you feel better.
It’s okay, Emma.
Nice one, Karen.
How did you get up there?
Hello?
Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape around the -- No, they’re not home yet. I don’t know, Emma hasn’t said a word to me -- He’s still upstairs -- yes, I’m sure he’s Japanese -- But -- Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can.
Hello there.
My name is Karen. What’s yours?
Emma, who were you talking to?
You should get some rest, Emma.
I’m not even sure what did happen.
No, that’s not what I mean...
That house. There was something...
Is that how they said she died?
I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for something like that.
Why don’t you find out when I can heck out of here.
Okay. Tired.
Three months. I needed a social welfare credit.
Yes.
Did you find him?
Yes, that’s right. He was... holding a cat. A black cat. There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a journal.
I don’t think so. I think it belonged to a woman.
The writing. It looked feminine.
I left it on the kitchen table.
I asked him his name. He said ‘Toshio’.
This is him. This is the boy.
Yes. Positive.
Detective Nakagawa?
The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was... wrong.
What happened there?
Toshio...
Why didn’t you tell me?
About the bodies they found in the attic.
The same thing happened three years ago, Doug. To a Japanese family, who lived in that house. They were all found dead.
How would you explain it?
-- trip over the curb and sprain your ankle.
Okay. Then explain this: when I went to that house, I didn’t know anything about its past. But yet I still saw...
Emma and I were alone in that room, but -- there was something else there. I’m sure of it.
You might be right, Doug. But I know what I saw. I think I know what I saw...
Yeah.
You’ve got class, and I’m sure I only have to fill out a few forms or something --.
I’m fine, Doug. Really.
That’s the boy who was there yesterday. In that house. But this boy, he’s -- he’s supposed to be dead.
I saw him, Doug. I talked to him. He told me his name. A boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name.
You don’t believe me.
Hello?
What?
Alex and Yoko are dead.
There’s something wrong with that house, Doug. Something really bad.
The boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to his wife... widow. If I can find out what happened, or if... maybe --.
You don’t understand. I have to, Doug.
Because I’ve been inside that house, Doug. Don’t you get it? I’ve been inside!
I love you. But I have to go.
I’m looking for Maria Kirk?
My name is Karen Davies. I’m a student at -- I’m sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Ms. Kirk?
I’m here because... I need to speak with you about your husband.
Maria --.
I just need a couple minutes.
Your husband, Peter. Three years ago he...
He killed himself.
I’m... sorry.
I didn’t.
I think there’s a connection between your husband’s death and something that happened to me.
It’s... hard to explain.
Look, I know this sounds strange, but... I don’t think your husband wanted to die.
If that’s true, then why are you still here in Japan?
Did you know a woman named Kayako?
Did Peter?
Maybe it was someone he worked with?
Please. I don’t know what else to do. Please help me.
Oh my God.
Excuse me, I need to speak with Detective Nakagawa.
It’s an emergency.
Yes, I have important information for him about a case...
His partner, Detective Igarashi? Can I speak with him?
They’re dead, aren’t they?
Doug?
No.
Doug! Where are you???
Doug???
Oh my God...
No more... please, no more...
DOUG! NO!!!
(shaking her head).
(nervous).
(nodding).
(nodding).
(heard it before).
(then, faltering).
(almost a whisper).
(intense).
(almost ashamed).
(under her breath).I won't.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Sure.
Laurie holds up a key.
Just watch.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of sixth grade.
See you.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Exploring uncharted territory?
I thought you were baby-sitting tonight.
Shit!
I forgot my chemistry book.
don't think so... I--.
Annie, some day you're going to get all of us in deep trouble.
I'm baby-sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Look.
Behind that bush there.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
He was standing right here.
Cute.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Okay. Bye.
Mister Brackett...
It's okay...
Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.
Hi, Mom, I'm home.
Thanks, mom.
Hello.
Who is this?
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Calm down. This is ridiculous.
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's backyard.
He was watching me.
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-o'-lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
Bye.
But King Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Hello.
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
Annie!
Hold on.
There's nobody there, Tommy. Go watch some TV.
After the movie.
After the Jack-o'-lantern.
There's no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
There was no one out there.
What did he look like?
We're not getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The Boogeyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get you.
I promise.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes, you can.
Wait a minute here...
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
The old girl scout comes through again.
What's wrong?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I said, stop it! There is no Boogeyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Nobody's going to get anybody. Now stop scaring each other.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of the movie.
Hello.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lindsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Finally.
Hello.
Hello?
All right, Annie! I've heard your famous chewing, now I get your famous squeals?
Annie?
Annie, Annie! Are you all right?
I'll kill you if this is a joke!
Annie...
Annie?
Hello?
All right, meatheads. The joke is over.
Come on, Annie, enough.
This has most definitely stopped being funny. Now cut it out!
You'll be sorry.
Help me! Help me!
Please, help me! Call the police! Please!
No! No! Please, open the door!
Tommy! Tommy, open the door!
Tommy, let me in!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
HURRY!
Please stop... Please...
It's all right now. Shhh, it's all right...
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
I killed him.../l>
Lock the door! Lock the door!
Tommy, it's me. Open the door.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
No! Do as I say.
Well, kiddo. Some Halloween...
It was the Boogeyman...
(sings).
(sings).
(excited).
(into phone).
(into phone).
(panicked).
(into phone).I can't sleep.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
Like a real sister?
Sure it does.
It's been eleven months.
You're lucky. I wish she could do the same for me.
God bless Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers. God bless Rachel, God Bless Sunday, god bless me. And god bless Mommy and Daddy in heaven. Amen.
Help! Help me, please!
Help me! Somebody help me!
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
I don't need to wear a stupid costume.
Stop it okay? Stop it.
Stop it. Please Stop it.
You're okay. You're okay.
Hi.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel.
Rachel, I found the perfect costume come see.
It was the nightmare man.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
I don't know.
Bye.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Thanks!
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Trick-or-treat.
Thank you.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Really?
Okay!
Rachel? Is that you? Is that you?
Whoever you are, I have a really big dog with me and he bites.
The kids at school were right.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Rachel?
Oh Rachel!
Rachel come on.
Come on.
Rachel!
I can't.
Rachel!
Rachel!
Rachel!
I've got you, I've got you.
Oh please come alive Rachel, please come alive. You can't be dead. Come alive Rachel!
Help! Please, somebody help me! Help! Please! Somebody help me!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
It's over there.
Then we'll be safe?
You don't believe that do you?
Oh, oh. Somebody help me!
No.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
No! He'll kill you too.I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
I just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body... Now, that's heart attack time.
And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so... Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me.
Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Ask her to dance.
Go on.
Say yes.
No means yes.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin' fine.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
It's Tyrell.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
I know it, and it feels good.
Hi, Ty.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.
Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --.
Yes!
Brazil? Um...
You don't know?! You have to know. You know everything...
Still here...thinking...
Five... Four...
Rio de Janeiro!
No. Yes?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Magic 96.7!
I won. I won... I won, I won, I won.
Now, let's see... There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins.
Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?.
That boy has got fish on the brain.
Hey, cheer up, Charlie.
We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah...
Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.
And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hey, sorry...
He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama Mama. We goin' Bahamas...
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Check it out.
Take a bath, maybe.
Hello? Hello?
Checking in... Karla Wilson.
Oh, what?
Is that bad?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!
That'll be just fine with us.
Wait... Did you say off-season?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.
I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Oooh, the mainland --.
Rio, baby!
Their stuff in there...
...and ours in here.
Promised me what, baby?
I made all my promises to William.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...
But...
Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours.
For the next foury-eight hours...
Your smile is a frown...turned upside down.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.
Am I right, sister?
To a great weekend --.
I'll drink to that!
So what do you do around here for fun?
Karaoke -- perfect.
Okay, I won't.
Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it.
Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!
Yes.
Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!
Julie...
Tha's it.
I've decided.
I'm changing my major to finance.
And going to Wall Street.
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Jacuzzi.
I spent a hundred bucks on it... even if it's just so you can pull it off.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Don't you get feisty...
I used to be a lifeguard... I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Ty!
How's Julie?
You're not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
You get any sleep at all?
Hey --.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you.
No, this is the safe sun.
It's better than a day at the beach.
Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new --.
Exactly.
Set to three seventy-five, bake for one hour...
Just kidding.
Damn. How many pairs you got in there?
Julie!
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
There were boats here? Refresh my memory, there were boats...
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie...
Julie, we have to do something.
Julie, where are you going?
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Be careful, Julie.
...Today's July fourth.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Why? He can't help us.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
It's too late for that.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Ty!
What do we do?
Oh, god, no --.
Oww...
It's locked!
Please! Hurry!
Hurry!
Come on!!
Julie, come on.
I don't know...
Julie?
I'm holding your hand!
...Nancy?
Help's here. Help's here.
Come on, come on.
Damn you.
Oh, god, it's you --.
Is he?
You know, it's true what they say about package vacations... You get what you pay for.
Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island.

Hi Mark!
So I was just calling to see if you were still wanting to get together.
I mean, not concretely. I was just seeing.
All right...!
Well. I’ve now sent her three emails and still no response... I’m starting to get a little nervous.
Yeah. Probably. I hope so.
Well, I don’t LET her. She’s bipolar.
Well - but she’s my sister. And even you admit this last email was different...
Okay. Yeah. You’re right. You are right.
No, I do know you’re right. I just needed to be reminded. Thank you. I’m really lucky to have you.
I love you.
Okay. See you later?
Okay. “Bye Mark!”
All right. Love you. Bye.
It’s just in his tone - you can hear it. It’s like he’s trying to work up the nerve to say something and I just keep staving it off.
Well - what if I scared him? I’m always roping him into my family crap... I’m always leaning on him! I tell him everything! I even called him today in tears because my sister sent me another scary email. What if I’m scaring him off?
No! Not if I went too far! What if I leaned too heavily?
But what if I need him too often? If it becomes a chore?
But he never asks for anything from me! I've never even seen him cry! So I'm the only one leaning!
...no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Hey.
I’m up.
I wasn’t sleeping anyway.
Okay. I’ll just get dressed.
...Oh yeah?
For when?
I mean - yeah. I’m okay. That was just... very weird.
The...Sweden! I had no idea.
Okay, fine, but I didn’t know you were going.
You already have a ticket!
It’s just -- imagine if we were at a party and someone asks "what are you doing this summer," and my friends say: "oh, we’re all going to Alaska for three months, we’re leaving in two weeks,” and imagine that was the first you’d ever heard of it!
You told me it would be “cool to go.”
I have no problem with you going! I just wish you'd involve me!
You didn't apologize, you said - "sorry." Which sounds more like "too bad.
...I’m just trying to understand.
I don't need an apology. I just wanna talk about it.
I'm not trying to attack you.
Well...I’m sorry! I am sorry. I just got confused.
Come on: Sit with me. I'm sorry. That just felt weird, that's all. I think going to Sweden could be really great for you. That sounds amazing. Are you going for your thesis?
I know! It could be inspiring! Right?
Please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overreact. Please.
I get paranoid. I'm sorry. I'm going through all this stuff and I've been dealing with all this panic and I just - overreacted. I'm not trying to put pressure or accuse you of anything. I just got crazy for a second. I didn't mean to project.
What do you mean?
To Sweden?
You don’t want me to.
After I broke down crying!
Hey.
How’s it going?
Nice.
Yeah!
I think so...! If it’s not completely destroying your guys’ male bonding plans.
Hey Pelle.
Ooh, that’s a nice drawing.
How’ve you been?
Uh, well - didn’t quite finish! But they’re giving me a break this year...
How did you like the anthropology department?
Psychology. Yeah. That’s how you know I’m nuts.
Yeah! I can’t wait. Christian says you’ve got a special thing in the woods planned?
Do you do that every midsummer?
Ooh. What makes this guy different?
...Christian says you’re from a really small community?
Depends on which of those you mean.
Oh wow! Flower children.
What’s your sign?
Cancer!
July seven.
Oh yeah? For who?
Oh...!
No, I mean - thank you. I just... I'm sorry.
I'll be right back. Bathroom. Thank you.
Oh - thank you.
How far are we driving?
Why are you reading that?
What are you doing your thesis on, again?
That’s similar to what you’re thinking of doing - right, baby? For your thesis?
See that, Pelle? You’ve managed to brainwash all your friends.
Oh my God.
Why??
This is horrible.
Fantastic. Thank you.
I think I might need to find my
footing first.
No, I just need to get settled.
No - go ahead!
You know what? That’s okay. I’m ready.
I don’t. I’m ready.
Yeah, Mark, thanks.
Okay. Yeah. I’ll have that. Thank you - Ingmar?
He’s not. It’ll get too complicated otherwise. It’s fine.
Yeah. It’s good. I’m excited.
A little like I have food poisoning.
I’m sorry. I’m gonna walk.
No, that’s not good. No. No.
No, no, no, no...
They were laughing at me over there.
It’s okay. It’s not that. You’re okay. It’s drugs.
This is a coffin.
Hey! No it’s not.
Fuck you. Stop it.
Don’t look in the mirror. It’s not your face.
“It’s not your face.”
What time is it?
You were almost born... You’re a baby.
MOMMY?!... DADDY?!...
Mommy daddy mommy daddy...
CHRISTIAN?!
No... no.... You’re alone.
You’re alone.
...Christian?!
I got lost.
Christian. Nothing means anything.
Nothing means anything! We’re just alone.
And I felt this presence - like God but not God - and it was telling me this and it was laughing at me.
I felt it laughing! I figured it out, that nothing means anything and we’re born alone and we die alone, and it was getting pleasure from that.
I wanna sleep. How can I sleep?
...how long was I asleep?
Did it get dark at all?
Is it tomorrow?
Where are we going?
Tack!
Thank you.
I love what you’re wearing.
Yeah. Wow.
Can we help at all?
Hello!
Ruben is lovely.
I’m too scared.
Oh - my gosh. Pelle!
Oh my God, not at all! It’s wonderful. Thank you, Pelle. I’m so touched.
Yeah, well - don’t worry. Christian forgot.
Or - I forgot to remind him. It doesn’t matter. Thank you so much for this, Pelle. It’s beautiful.
Oh, jeez...almost three years now!
...You’re joking. It’ll be three in fifteen days.
Oh wow. Congratulations.
We’ve actually asked Ingemar to officiate the wedding.
You did?!
That’s so beautiful.
What happens when you turn 72, then?
Who are these of?
Excuse me? Can I ask if you know what’s happening over there?
Oh no. Rickets?
Do you know what they’re doing?
Like a - sympathetic connection?
Fine. It’s fine. I’m not upset. - I know I should!
Pretty serious-looking cribs.
How real is that stuff for you guys?
Is it scary?
Ja!
Is your baby okay?
Oh, I’m sorry...!
Mine? Oh no, mine are...not here anymore.
Ha. Unfortunately not. It’s okay...
Oh God, no, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said. We’re enjoying our food.
No no. I just shouldn’t have mentioned it..
Okay, thank you. Sorry. I feel silly. Thank you.
Sorry.
Is this gonna be something weird?
...Is this the thing you mentioned last night?
...Do I not want to do this?
Okay. And what is “this”?
What is Ättestupan?
No. I need to try.
I need to not be here right now.
I can’t stop fucking shaking and my teeth keep chattering.
I feel like the neck on my skin is getting tighter. Like I’m choking.
Are you just not at all disturbed by what happened?
Why? What’s happening?
Did they tell you what this is?
No. What’s happening?
NO!!!
Please Christian - we need to leave. This is feeling really wrong.
No, Christian: this is pagan nature worship. This is completely backwards. We shouldn’t be here.
I don’t want to acclimate! I want to leave.
What? Since when?!
So let him have it if he wants it! We shouldn’t be here, Christian.
And why would he trust you, of all people? You’re opportunistic anthropology students.
Oh my God, are you blind? They’re performing pagan rituals out here! People are jumping off cliffs. They depend on nobody knowing about this!
I want to leave.
...Do you not love me anymore?
This is the devaluation phase. We've been in it for a long time now. Next comes the discard.
No - this has been happening for a long time! You’ve been pulling away... And I've been in denial.
Oh my -- you’re gonna walk away now??
You’re just gonna leave me like this?!
Do you have a sleeping pill?
I just need to sleep.
Christian?
Oh!
I’m sorry about last night.
I don’t want us to be fighting, Christian.
Do I want to stay for this?
I’m really sorry, Pelle. Thank you for inviting me, but I really need to go. Can someone maybe drive me?
I don’t know why we’re here, Pelle! I don’t know why you invited us!
But I’m not an anthropologist. I don’t have the foundation to understand this.
What is it?
What am I going through? I’m scared. I can’t breathe.
What?!
That’s not what I’m talking about!
Christian could walk in.
You’re a very empathic person, do you know that?
Can I smell that again?
Are you okay, Connie?
Yeah, it was lovely meeting you, too.
I understand. I might be right behind you.
No. We didn’t.
Connie-dot-Brahms. I’ll write you.
...Simon left without Connie.
Sure! But actually - have you seen Simon?
No. I didn’t. But that’s okay...
What are we making?
Oh! She’s so beautiful!
Do you know what happened with Connie?
Why do you think Simon would leave without her?
I could see you possibly doing that.
Never mind.
What is it?
Ew.
Somebody for everybody, I guess.
Hey, can I steal another sleeping pill? Only half this time.
Could Mark still be off with that girl?
Then what about Josh?
We did see Mark go off with one of the girls last night.
Do you know what we’re doing?
It’s just water?
Josh...?
What?
There’s nothing there.
I don’t speak Swedish!
Aewobeemeewish!
Aewabeeny-sa-aewonnerstabloo!
Weerabbleeishcobleraymib!
It’s over?
Why? Me?
What do you mean?!
What’s happening?!
What does this mean? What do I have to do?
Christian?!
For what?
What? I can’t. That’s too big.
...I don’t know if this is real, or what’s happening - but... thank you.
Can Christian come with me?
What’s there?
What about there?
...Why?

How come?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
I only know him a few weeks, Kerry.
That's okay, I wanted to.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Let me look at your eye...
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You mean a shithead.
Okay... thanks.
Jesse, hi...
Oh... that's okay. Sorry you can't make it.
No, I understand. Parents can be real pains... I'll see you in the morning, then...
I told her you invited me over. I guess I should have called, huh?
I know.
I figured you might like some help.
Where does this go?
What's this?
Hey, this thing is five years old.
Uh-uh. Before my time.
I think it's sad...
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Wow, listen to this!
What is it?
Wow...
Are you okay.
No... thanks. I better get back.
Got a major paper due the end of this week.
World History.
But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Hot stuff. Let me know how it turns out.
This is amazing! Your dream told you where this was?
Who?
Maybe you were having a premonition or something. You know, like those guys who help the police solve crimes and find missing people. You ever had anything like this happen before?
I don't know.
Can I look at that diary for a little while?
Thanks.
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Last party I had, Dad insisted on playing nothing but Benny Goodman records all night.
I'll see you later, okay?
I just got here myself. Went to the Public Library.
Research.
Hi.
C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I'm convinced you've had a genuine psychic vision.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before. But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and never do. It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
You don't have to. You just have to believe in energy.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What about "essential energy" the soul. Does that go into the air too? You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
It's a surprise.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room? Fred Krueger worked here. It's an old powerplant - a steam generator!
Here.
I did some reading up on our friend, Fred Krueger.
He kidnapped twenty kids and brought them all here to die.
So, you feeling anything?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know. Concentrate or something.
Shhh. Just concentrate.
Anything?
About what?
I'll get over it.
You are sensitive. I mean you sensed that the rat was there. And I can feel something about you. Sometimes I feel like I know what you're thinking.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Maybe we can do that. Strictly scientific, of course.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
What is it - What's wrong?
What is it?
Oh, Jesse...
Jesse, this is no good. You've got to get some sleep, Jesse. You've got to get some sleep.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I wish you'd talk to me. We can figure it out, you know. We can figure it out together.
What's that?
You're going out?
Thanks, Mom.
Twelve-thirty. I promise.
Goodnight, Daddy.
Jesse?
Why won't you talk to me?
You're not being fair to me. I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
It's okay, Jesse.
We'll figure it out together. We'll stay up all night if we have to. I won't let anything happen to you.
What's wrong?
He won't talk to me.
I shoud go see him, but...I don't know, the party and all...
Thanks, Patty. You're a pal.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
Who? Who's doing this to you?
No, Jesse. This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I'm not gonna let anyone take you from me. There's got to be a reason. We'll figure it out together.
Wait a minute!
Wait in here for me. I'll be right back.
Something Nancy said - her last entry.
She wasn't crazy. All this really happened.
You can fight him.
Remember what I said? About good energy and bad energy? He thrives on bad energy. Hate, anger, fear. He is bad energy.
You've been afraid of him.
Fight it, Jesse!
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear. Fight him, Jesse!
You're not afraid of him! He doesn't even exist.
Jesse!
Jesse, help!
Please, God...
He couldn't do it, Momma.
Please work, please.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Jesse!
Where's Jesse?
I want him back. Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
I love you, Jesse!
I'm not afraid of you. You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back. I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Come back to me, Jesse.
I love you, Jesse. Come back to me.
He can't hold you Jesse. He's losing his grip - you can get out.

I got through.
I found a room.
I said: I found a room.
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
No, no. Not just yet. It needs ... er ... some work.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Great.
Maybe tomorrow. I got to go look for a job.
I love you too.
Hi.
Not much.
Dad?
Big house.
Me like.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Shit! Shit!
Sure.
Have you got a towel?
Hi. I got soaked.
Which is where?
Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way? Waterloo. Centre of the known universe.
What's happening?
Where's my father?
Sure.
What happened?
Sure.
I've forgotten.
That's right. Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I know.
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
I'm here.
I'm coming!
Sleep well.
You know I do know the way home.
Not that late.
All right.
No. That's nice.
What do we do if there isn't?
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn ... English.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.
I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
It's not what I heard.
In a moment.
You keep your --.
Oh. Hi.
I don't finish till twelve.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Yeah.
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She's not like Mom. She's ... I don't know ... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
I don't know her. She's so ... sealed up.
Really?
What?
Sure.
Oh my God.
Julia!
Keep your fucking distance. Julia! Where's Julia? Christ, what have you done with her.
No.
No.
No. Get the fuck off me.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --.
This isn't happening.
No.
You want it?
This isn't happening.I think so.
I think so.
Tender.
I want to speak to my father ...
Why not?
Um.
Sure.
He's probably got a meeting. I called a friend of mine. He's coming; is that O.K.?
Where the hell did you come from?
It's just a puzzle box.
Who are you?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
This isn't for real.
Don't touch me!
Steve. Thank God you came.
These THINGS ... they want to take me --.
No!
Don't let them take me, Steve --.
Please go, Steve.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
Let me alone, will you?
Wait!
You did this before, right?
To a man called Frank Cotton?
But he escaped you.
HE did. I've seen him. He's alive.
I'll take you to him. Then you take him instead of me. Back wherever you come from.
Please! Dad! It's me! It's Kirsty!
Please, answer me! Please --.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
I was here this afternoon.
I saw everything.
Oh God. Thank God. I thought something might have ...
No. You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house. And he's --.
Finished?
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I want to see.
Yes!
I have to get out.
I can't stay.
Oh my God.
What are you doing here?
God --.
Go on. Kill me. I don't care.
You bastard.
Frank.
What took you so long?
We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of it.
Julia?
Don't!
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Not tonight.

(quietly).Kido. It's four in the morning.
What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn't know that.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday.
Sleep tight. We'll have French toast for breakfast, okay? Come on Sunday. Night night.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Mom, please.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment. But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Oh...
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Jamie!
Jamie, are you okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
I don't know.
Jamie.
You bet.
Call me.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
In a second.
We need to talk.
Its about tonight.
My parents' baby-sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Don't get angry.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Jamie, what happened?
What?
You're okay. You probably saw a mask and it scared you. At least you're not cut. Come on, let's go home.
She'll be fine.
Here I am.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
You're gonna be late. You don't want to blow your promotion.
Good luck, Dad.
Yeah, hurry up.
Is Brady there?
He's not back from work yet?
Okay...Well when he comes in could you tell him to drop by at about eight. I should be home by then.
This is Rachel. Okay, bye.
Come on Jamie, your gonna miss all the good Candy.
Come on Jamie.
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Jamie, wait for me.
Thank you.
Had enough?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Go ahead.
Hi.
You don't owe me anything.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Jamie!
Jamie! Jamie! Great Rachel, just great.
Jamie!
Jamie!
Jamie? Jamie!
Jamie?
Jamie?
Oh God!
Jamie.
Jamie! Where have you been? Don't ever go off on your own at night again okay? Not ever.
What's going on?
Okay.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Jamie's sleeping. When can we go home?
I'm trying.
She's fine.
Are you looking for this?
You knew. You just didn't care.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Have some coffee.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
Uh huh.
Ah, okay, great. We'll be waiting.
Ah, over and out.
Deputy Logan?
Deputy?
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
Jamie!!! Jamie!!
Oh God! Oh God!
I've gotta find Jamie.
Not without Jamie.
She's not dead!
I don't know!
What does that mean?
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Brady!
No.
Leave us alone, just leave us alone.
Jamie!
Go! Go!
Come on! Come on!
Jamie, get down. Get down.
Get on my back Jamie. Get on, hold on.
Grab on, Jamie.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
<Well try dammit!/l>
I'm gonna lower you down Jamie okay?
I've got you come on, go down.
I've got you Jamie.
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
He's inside.
<In the school./l>
We have to get out of Haddonfield, the state police at on their way let them handle it.
Jamie!
Die you son of a bitch.
Jamie, I want you to stay right here in the truck.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Don't touch him Jamie!
(laughs).
(scared).Listen, Harvey, you punctilious prick! You touch paragraph two and I'm coming down there and poking your fucking eye out with that little red pencil you like so much!
I am being objective! The congressman is a lying sack of shit and I'm saying so in my piece! Objectively.
You will not bury it -- you will keep it where it is, above the fucking fold, or I'll call Jameson and --.
Harvey -- do not touch my column! Shit!
Sorry, I'm late.
Uh, sure. Call me Rachel.
Yeah. He... certainly is.
Well, sooner or later in life, I think that's a good skill to have.
Rachel.
Yes, and I'm working on finding him some day care. It's just that right now I'm kinda --.
Like you said, he's not the talkative type.
He knows I'm there.
That's his cousin. That's Katie.
Looks like she's sleeping.
Huh...
Listen, I appreciate your concern, but two nights ago he lost his best friend. He's just trying to deal with it.
He'll be okay.
That's right.
Nothing.
Hey, have you seen my black church dress anywhere?! Aidan?
Have you seen my...
...church dress...
It's fine...
Zip me up?
Thanks.
Ruthie...
Me, too.
You all right, Dave?
Yes, she was.
They must have some theory.
And Aidan.
She never said anything. Nothing that would... help explain what happened.
Not enough, according to my editor.
What're you doing in there?
C'mon. You shouldn't be in her room.
Hi.
What's this tape you're talking about?
Katie watch it?
She was acting sorta strange last week, wasn't she.
What's on the tape?
And Katie told you she saw this?
Where's he? Is he here?
How did Josh die?
I heard these kids talking about a videotape.
Not a normal one...
The one that kills you.
As if you'd rent out a movie that'd kill your customers.
Why do you think people spread rumors about these fake tapes?
You get the back?
Okay.
Sweet dreams.
I don't know. Good question.
Maybe.
Be nice, wouldn't it?
Okay, Mister.
I got some homework to do.
Look, Aidan. I know I've been working a lot, but I promise I'll make it up --.
You have lots of time.
No. No one does. But I know you don't have to worry about it.
Katie told you she was going to die?
At ten o'clock.
Time of death, Wade, that's all I want to know. The name's Katie Embry -- pull the report, read the time. That's okay -- I'll hold.
Nice alliteration, huh?
No, I'm not.
Of course, I'm not. I'm cooking too good a story.
Four kids died on the same night.
Whatta you mean "and?" This is huge. This is drugs. This is sex -- all the stuff you like, Harvey.
Wade -- yeah, I'm here...
What's the time of death?
Hi, Dave.
Is Ruth home?
Dave let me in.
He's gone back to work?
Did you know Katie had a boyfriend at another school?
He killed himself last week. On the same night as Katie.
Two other kids from Josh's school also died. On the same night.
I don't know, Ruth. Could she have been into something you didn't know about?
No. It wasn't. That was you and me. Mostly me.
She didn't tell you about her boyfriend.
Ruth, I'm not --.
Oh Ruthie... I'm sorry.
All right...
I believe you.
Nice.
Hi.
No.
I was wondering if you'd remember someone. From over week ago.
It's my niece. She... she sorta ran out on her parents. Her boyfriend, another couple, I think they stayed here a night or so --.
Oh?
I imagine the mountains, it isn't.
Quite a selection.
Uh-huh...
You know, I'm a little tired. Maybe I'll take a nap before I drive back./l>
I'll take Cabin twelve.
That's it.
Thank you. I really needed to --.
Look, I know you're not exactly a morning person, although it might interest you to know that the rest of the world sleeps at night and works during the --.
What are you doing?
I wanna show you something.
What do you think?
Take my picture.
No. Scan the rest.
It's an eclipse.
It's supposed to ring.
It'll ring.
I'm not tired, Noah.
That tape didn't scare you?
Four people are dead, Noah. Four people who watched it.
Noah --.
Would you say that I'm gullible?
Easily rattled?
Who made it? Where'd it come from?
Thank you.
Same problem got copied, I guess.
So why do we see picture?
I mean, if there's no control track --.
That means--.
Shelter Mountain Inn, it's off 81. One of their guests left it.
I knew I came to the right place.
Fucking Noah didn't mind at the time.
What's that?
No, I mean up there. At the top.
Wait, whoa, go back. There was something there --.
There's more picture.
It's on the tape... and it's off the screen.
Y'know, I'm late, I really should go --.
I gotta go.
I don't want her to see it.
I did have a problem!
Fuck her, Noah. I'm all bugged about you.
You said the tape was interesting. Then she walks in and suddenly it's not.
I came to you for help and now you're blowing me off.
Or for me, right?
That's all right.
Because you're right. It's just a prank. I mean, it's supposed to scare you, right?
It's just pictures and sound.
Sorry to bother you.
I need your help, Becca...
Do you remember anything about that night with Katie?
Do you remember... how she died?
Did you see her die, Becca?
I know... that you saw something... and it scared you. Whatever you say you saw... I'll believe you.
How did she die, Becca? I want to know.
I will, what do you mean I will --.
Who... who'll show me... who...
I'd really rather watch it alone.
Really.
Come on, show me, come on...
Horses...
...lighthouse...?
Shit -- come back --.
Oh my God...
Anna Morgan...
Hi.
Everything okay?
Really?
Huh.
Thank you. Good-night.
Aidan --.
NO!
Why. Why, baby, why...
LEAVE HIM ALONE
Noah... it's you...
You do, huh.
He watched the tape...
Our son.
Do me a favor. Unplug it.
Time to go, Mister.
They were horse breeders -- And and Victor Morgan. There were problems with their horses, she was depressed, she was seeing doctors...
...her hospital was U of Maine, at Orono. On the tape there's a hospital room. At my house, I saw a hospital room --.
We don't have time. You visit the hospital, I'll visit the island. The images on the tape, they're leading us somewhere. We have to follow them.
The ladder, the fly, the room... Katie saw them all too...
I think before you die, you see the ring.
No one else can ever see this. Ever. If my time runs out --.
-- you have to destroy this. So it ends with us.
Nothing.
Hey there, shh, it's all right --.
Settle down, stop, hey --.
I was wondering if you'd have a moment to speak with me. My name's Rachel Keller -- I'm a writer. With the --.
Uh, well...
I didn't mean to... it's just I wasn't able to find a number... to reach you --.
I was hoping you had a few minutes.
I read you had to put so many down. And others... they drowned themselves. As if they sort of... went crazy.
Something scaring them, maybe.
Where are your horses now?
You don't?
She... she killed herself?
It must have been hard on her... the problems... with the horses...
I... well, I...
Do you know what this is?
It won't make sense, what I want to say... but I want to say it. Sometimes people who are dead, they say... still try to communicate. To send messages. To us, to the people still living. And I think this tape... may be a message. From your wife.
Your wife is on this tape. She's there, right in that room. You see the lighthouse, the horses, your horses, her horses --.
No.
Mr. Morgan, hear me out --.
Mr. Morgan --.
Aidan, the house you drew for me...
Did you see it in your head -- is that why you drew it? Was it a picture in your head?
Aidan, why did you draw that house?
Who... who told you to...
Hi.
Do you know Victor Morgan?
The Morgan horse farm, Victor and Anna Morgan --.
Can you tell me... They had a child, didn't they. A girl.
Can you tell me about her.
And what was that?
What happened to the girl? Samara?
Because Morgan sent the girl away?
Where is she -- where's your child?
What happened to your child --.
They say you sent her away. You never sent her anywhere, did you...
She's hurting people. She's hurting people because she's been hurt. She's hurting me, my son, it has to stop --.
Where is she... please --.
Mr. Morgen, please help me --.
WAIT, NO!
They... they had a child...
I think he killed her.
We have to know what happened... she wants us to know what happened...
We have to know what happened...
Not anymore.
He kept her here... Her mother was going crazy. Morgan blamed the child. So he kept her here. Alone.
What if she couldn't control it? Making pictures? Sending pictures?
Who says she meant to?
What if it's the only way she knew to communicate.
The phone.
It only rang for me.
You and Aidan, it didn't ring. Just me. At the cabin -- in the mountains, Shelter Mountain... oh my god...
I've seen this tree. I've seen it burning...
The cabins have only been there for fifteen years...
The sun came right through the leaves, lit them up like it was on fire, right at sunset... Right when I watched the tape.
Katie and her friends, they died at ten that night, all of them. They must have watched it at ten...
Noah, stop... Noah, wait...
NOAH!
Drop something.
How long until sunset?
Everything we've done has led us here. All she's showed us -- it's for a reason --.
If all she wants is us dead, I'm not waiting till sunset. She's a big girl now. She can kill me herself.
Noah, what do you see? Noah?!
Heavy... why is water so heavy...
Will you take care of him, Noah...
Without me...
Take me down...
I'm here, Samara... I'm listening...
I'm so sorry...
We're here...
Her own mother. She was that afraid... of her own child.
She was just a child...
Seven days.
You could survive for seven days.
I miss you.
Hi, A-Bear.
want you to promise me something. If there's ever anything you're feeling, that you think I won't want to hear, or won't understand... I want you to tell me. Because I'll always want to listen. Always.
For a long time, she was all alone. And it made her sad. And it made her angry. But it's all right now. She's not alone anymore. We know about her now... and now other people know --.
No... Aidan, what's wrong --.
Because we helped her --.
Aidan, what, it's all right --.
I'm with you, I'm here -- you're safe! She's all right now, she's sleeping -- like Katie, in your drawing -- see! She's sleeping!
Pick up the phone, Noah, pick up the phone...
Where are you, Noah...
PICK UP THE GODDAMNP HONE!
What did I do... what did I do...
STAY IN YOUR ROOM AND LOCK THE DOOR!
We heard you! We listened!
Wasn't that enough...
What do you WANT!
Why not me...
What did I do that he didn't...
You and me.

You mean "We're on the Road to Nowhere?"
OK that's real funny guys. Wanna hang up now? You're tying up the line... Hey c'mon...
Yah, later sports. Just hang up OK?
Ya hear this, L.G.? Can't you cut these jerks off?
Wuh, they're off. How'd you do it L.G.?
You need a witness. I'm a witness.
This Porsche, it wasn't an accident. I was talking to the kids when it happened. These new stories make it like you're nuts; but you're not nuts, Mister --.
No. But I heard it --.
No listen: it's here on tape. Regulations. We gotta record all the calls. End of the night we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one it was so weird...
Here. It's right on here.
Evidence, sort of. Look: I'm a DJ on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett north of here. Got a nightly phone-in request show, and two nights ago these boys tied up my line with their car-phone and right in my own ears I heard something terrible happen. I didn't know what I'd heard, then I read your stories and I think what you're talking about is on this tape.
But this is real. You could use it to get people to believe you --.
Yeh but I am. Look at it this way: Destiny turned on the radio and tuned it right to my show...
I'm right in the middle of this story. Don'tcha see? I could break this story and do something real. I could help you...
But you can't do it alone --.
Right now? You wanna hear it --.
Hey, now wait mister --.
Yeh but it's, there's a lot of static, it's not clear what's going on. Anyway, I don't think it'd be legal to do this. FCC regulations --.
But why? Play the tape on-theair for what?
You got an awful lot of pride, Mister. Said you'd do this alone. What's changed that?
OK. But call me 'Stretch', Mister.
...so here's a special request we're doing tonight. You steady listeners know we're playing it every hour... This is for Lefty...
...this concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas. It's 12 midnight Central Standard Time...
Nope.
L.G., it was a request, right? It's in the logs as a request. People complain about requests every night. Right?
Nope.
'night, L.G.
No. We're closed. Off-the-air till tomorrow. Come back...
OK, a quick tour. But seriously quick and it ends at the Exit sign, OK?
Un-huh. These are the turntables...
Yeh. The storage room. We got no 'frig, but the ice works...
The record vault's full of oldies, I bet it's in there --
They live on fear, they live on fear...
How, how mad at me are you?... You're not really mad at me?...
How good are you, huh?...
How... good... are... you?...
Oh?... Really?...
Are you... really good?...
Really, really good?...
No, they'll get away. They can't...
Oh God, damnit Lefty you're late.
Uh-oh...
Urm. No I don't chew gum. Bad for your teeth.
Ahm... Listen: thanks for the gum... but... I gotta go home now. Y'know? Can't just hang out all night...
No. No! Put that down! No: what is that?! Is that wet? Is that wet?! Put it down! No --.
You're pissed off?? What about me? Listen: this isn't going to work. I'm trying to be open with you. It's nobody's fault. I just can't do this. Lemme go...
Lefty...
Lefty: it's me!
Lefty?...
Lefty... It's you, Lefty?...
Come on Lefty...
Pray for my soul, pray for my soul, pray for my soul...
(pause).I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they... well they're not around anymore. You see I... I...
I killed a man. Well, I thought I had... then...
You've got to understand... It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't.
I have these dreams... horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me.
You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't... gotten away with it.
I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt... to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis...
You know? But how could you...
I'm sorry --.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I had another dream, Will.
It was in a church... it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It was one year ago...
I'm trying. I really am... Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you getting out of town on the fourth?
Are you sure?
Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Why are you being like this?
Ray, I can't...
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.
It just isn't.
Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And... there's a million things to do.
Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.
Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just scared... that's all.
Okay. Okay. Face your fears...
There's nothing...
Okay, calm down, imagination.
I can't take this anymore. I can't.
Let's just do it.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
There's nothing between Will and me.
No I'm not.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
What?
Ben...
That could break the machine.
The number's unlisted...
Okay, okay. You're right.
...South America... Carnival...
Magic 96.7!
Hi.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --.
It's okay.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...
You know...
It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free!
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Will you try... for me, please?
Ray... please try. I really miss you.
Okay. Bye.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
But, he said he'd try.
He does work hard.
Then, don't.
Oh!
You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas!
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Deep breaths --.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
I'm the King of the World.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
It's pretty remote here.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Your what?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Storm season?
It beats being on the mainland.
Why's that?
Karla! You promised.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --./l>
I miss Ray... I tried to call him.
I'm Julie. This is Karla.
I'll drink to that!
Don't even think about it.
No way.
No.
Not me... no way...
You asked for it.
Song number thirty-nine.
And I still know... what you did... last summer...
It's... him.
He did something to the screen... it, it, said...
Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...
There's no way... just stop it right now...
Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
No -- it's not that. It's... I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Will...?
Will?
Is that you?
It's happening again! There's a body!
It's in my room!
There was a body! I swear it!
I wasn't dreaming.
Listen to me. He's here.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I want off this island.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
It's dead.
Some.
It's okay... He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
Houseplant.
Karla!
You say something?
Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny.
I'm not crazy... I'm not crazy. He's here...
We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Ben Willis.
They never found the body.
Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen. ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up --.
I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job.
It's not him.
Voodoo.
Leave him alone.
Let him go. I believe him.
He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't.
Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right... This whole thing was a setup.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
I don't know.
How do we know you're not?
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Did he do it?
I've got to see.
I'm not dying on this island, Will.
Do you hear me?
You want me, Ben Willis? Come and get me. I'm right here.
My grave stays empty!
Then, we fight --.
I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault.
Wait, it's Nancy --.
Get used to it.
There's no way to lock it.
You sick freak.
Karla!
He's inside.
Come on...
Nancy...
No way!!
Move!
Come on, gimme a shot --.
Come on, you can make it.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand.
No, you're not.
All right --.
Did you get help?
What happened?
He's in it with Willis?
Your stomach, you're hurt --.
Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death.
We need a first-aid kit.
Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up.
You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound.
Why are you doing this to me?
I trusted you.
...Why?
OMIGOD --.
No, no, no --.
Just... Die.
You're okay. Thank god.
We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret.
Ray... what are you doing?
Never do that again.
I love it here.
You know me to well.

Morgan you ass!
Well could you do it when Kemper and I are not so close together, please?
You wouldn't stop.
You're telling me you have batteries inside you or something?
Maybe on the next pit stop.
Morgan, we'll make it in time okay. In the meantime, why don't you smoke some of that yourself?
We need gas?
Perfect.
The feeling is mutual, shithead.
Of course not...we can skip right to the part where I beat the crap out of you, if you wish.
I could wipe the windshield with you right now, you weak-ass little weasel!
I'm sorry, Morgan.
I am, I don't know what I was thinking.
What the hell is that suppose to mean?
Do you want me to hit you again?
That might come sooner than you think.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Not when I tell mom and dad the real reason why you went on this trip.
I was not!
Hey... hey, look...
Morgan, do you always just think about yourself?
Money's not an option right now, Morgan.
Pull over and pick her up.
Hey, are you okay?
Can we give you a ride?
Do you live anywhere near here?
Well, we could at least give you a ride. You look exhausted. Come on in, we'll take you wherever you want to go.
Who... um... who killed them?
Just keep driving. If she was out here then there has to be a gas station or house or something out here...It can't be that deserted.
You're the one who's stoned all the time! You want me to punch you again, don't you?!
I'm sorry.
We need to find someone.
Morgan!
Morgan, I really think that Jane is a little more important than some stupid weed.
So...?
What?
I'll come with you.
That's for sure.
I don't know why we're even looking out here, I mean clearly there is no one here...
What the hell was she talking about in there? Who killed her friends?
If we find anyone.
Hey...
This is unbelievable.
Let's just go and call the police.
Is anyone home?
Somebody has to be home.
Just go and get the others and I'll stay here.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Kemper, just go get the others. I'll be fine.
Hello?
We need help... Is anyone here?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Is anyone here?
Jesus, Kemper, you scared the shit out of me.
Don't worry about it. Find everyone?
Not even a phone.
It doesn't seem like anyone's home.
Great...
Oh my god...
I'm going back in there as soon as I can. I know there's a phone in there. I can feel it.
Do you only think of yourself, Morgan?
Knowing them, forever.
I... I... I just saw something...
Oh my god... It's Jane...
Just put it back, Morgan.
Oh my god...
Their completely twisted, you know that?
What were they all doing here?
You guys have to check this out.
We don't know... I think these people have something to do with the thing Jane was talking about in the van.
That's what we think.
I'm not sure... I think they went back inside the house.
Not without me you're not.
I need to find a phone.
Look at this stuff...
If only it worked.
What the hell was that?
Where is everybody?
Hello?
There's no dial tone.
Someone has to be here. Why would all this shit be here?
Old collectables and a broken phone.
Let's just go back to the yard.
Nope.
Pepper, just wait, okay? He'll be out in a second. It takes a long time to tell the cops exactly where this house is located.
Which is probably why he's taking so long.
Pepper, I'm coming with you.
I'll check upstairs. The rest of you can join Pepper. She needs all the help she can get.
Andy? Andy, are you here?
What the hell is going on?
I'm sorry... We were only looking for a phone.
Please, we need to call the police.
What do we do now?
Pepper's gone.
What do you think I mean by gone? She isn't here!
Oh, God... she could get herself killed out here!
Pepper's missing.
Of course she isn't here, moron!
I'm gonna go look for her. Anyone coming?
I'm not leaving. Not until we find Pepper and Andy, okay?
I've never seen such a family with so many collectables before. Not even my grandmother could afford shit like this...
Shit...
Morgan?
Was that you?
I'm gonna look upstairs.
Andy? Pepper?
Open the door you guys. I know what you're doing in there... Come on... open the door!
KEMPER!
We have to get out of here. We need to get Morgan and get out of here.
These people are fucking crazy that's what now let's go!
Morgan!
I don't know but if they're not at the van then god knows where the hell they might be. MORGAN!
Morgan, where the hell are you, come on!
Morgan! We have to get out of here, this isn't funny!
Where is everybody?
Bullshit! My friends were in here and I want to know what the hell you did with them!?
Not until we find our friends!
KEMPER!
Jesus Christ, Kemper...
What the hell are we suppose to do!?
I wouldn't think of anything else... Kemper, what the hell are we gonna do! The van doesn't work and our friends are fucking missing!
Hey...
You're shitting me.
No... I thought you had them.
I don't think so... Everyone was with us... No one could have taken them except for --.
Jane... You said Jane wasn't here when Pepper came back, right?
I don't know. But wherever she is, I'm going to go look for her.
Why not?
Didn't you bring a flashlight?
Let me see it.
Okay, but let me hold the flashlight.
She could be at that house but I'm not going back there.
I don't know. Why the hell couldn't we find everybody, huh?
She could and she couldn't have, but I'm not taking any fucking chances. I'm looking for her.
Whatever you say.
It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault.
I know, Kemper. Even though you didn't cause any of this, I accept your apology.
Kemper...
I love you.
I need to find her. We need to get those keys and get the hell out of here.
Come on.
Let's just keep checking.
We can't go anywhere in the van unless we have the keys. Now we have to find her.
Who else could have them? Didn't you leave them in the ignition when we left?
No one was in there after we left except Jane, and she was gone when Pepper came back. How can you explain that?
Something has got to be out here.
No shit. They might be there, but I'm not taking any chances. We need to find somebody else than those creeps.
I don't know...
Pepper? Morgan?
Wait...
Guys!?
You don't know for sure...Andy! Pepper! Morgan!
KEMPER! COME ON!
Kemper...
Not without you!
COME ON!
No...!
Kemper, I'm not leaving you!
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!
Hello? Somebody please help me!
PLEASE!
HELLO? SOMEBODY... PLEASE HELP ME!
COME ON!
Morgan... Morgan, we must get out of here now!
Morgan...?
Morgan... Morgan! Get up!
Morgan!
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!
HELP ME!
HELP ME! PLEASE!
PLEASE! PLEASE HELP ME!
Please help me!
HE'S KILLING THEM!
THE MAN... HE'S KILLING MY FRIENDS! PLEASE! HELP ME!
There was a man... and he was killing all my friends... He was coming after me... With a chainsaw.
I'M NOT LYING! He's in the woods with a chainsaw! He killed all of my friends!
NO! Please! Please don't leave me!
But he was chasing me with a chainsaw!
Hi...
Erin.
My friends and I were on our way to Mexico... Then our van broke down.
No...
We went looking for help... But we didn't find anything. Are you taking me to the police station?
No...
I'd rather just go to the station.
I just want to go to the station please.
I just want to go home.
I don't know.
Where are we going?
No... NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?
Kemper! Kemper!
Kemper, we have to get the fuck out of here now!
I'll help you, just get up! We need to leave, now!
Oh, god, Kemper...
SHIT!
We need to get you out of here...
I don't know... There's no way except for the front...
Kemper, no! Just stay with me, okay? You're not going to leave me! Just stay the fuck awake!
Shit...
SHIT!
Kemper, I found a way out, but you need to stand up. You need to help me.
Kemper, don't do this! We need to get out of here now!
COME ON!
Oh, shit...
WE NEED TO GO!
NO! LET ME GO!
No!
NO!
OH, GOD, NO!
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
HELP ME!
PLEASE! OPEN THE DOOR!
Just go! Please!
DRIVE! PLEASE!
It's a long story, I just want to go home.
I dunno...
Thanks... for the ride...
How much longer is it?
No... No thank you...
I... I just want to go home.
No... NO!
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?
NO! PLEASE!
PLEASE! HELP ME!
NO!
NO!
PLEASE! STOP!
GO! GO!
(crying).
(laughs).
(huffs).
(into screen).
(pointing).
(crying).
(wipes her tears).
(trying not to cry).No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
No, he quit - the whole God thing - he has issues. The previews for next week...
Hold up... someone's calling.
Chi Omega House.
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Teddy's on the other line. He sounds drunk. I'll call you back.
I won't.
Alright, alright... I'll call you back.
Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's up?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said goodbye?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Hello? Hello? Where'd you go?
Just a second.
Yes?
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
I heard a noise.
Upstairs.
Shit.
Hello? Hello?
Stop it...
I don't think I'm alone.
I'm outta here.
Outside.
Hey, you? HELLO? HELLO?
There's something going on at the Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down.
What? I can't hear you...
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Hello, I'm calling from the Chi Omega...
Shit.
I'm calling...
I'm calling from the Chi Omega house. Someone is harassing me. Hello?
Shit!
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Hello?
Where are you?
They're at Grogs.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
Hello?
(on phone).
(she clicks over).
(clicks over.
(calling out).
(soft whisper).
(calling out to him).
Lucky us.
That's not our system.
This is commercial vessel Nostromo. Registration number 180246. Do you read me.  Over.
Nothing.
It's not our system.
Report to the mess.
Turbulence.
We're down.
Engine room, what happened.
I don't see anything. We've still got pressure.
Is that it.
Get started on 4 panel. I'll be down in five minutes.
Fifteen to twenty hours...
Working on it.
Yeah.
You know the answer to that.
Don't worry, you'll both get what's coming to you.
You're guaranteed by law that you'll get a share... Now both of you knock it off and get back to work.
You ought to be able to handle the rest.
If you run into trouble, I'll be on the bridge.
How's it going.
Have you tried putting the transmission through ECIU.
I'll give it a shot.
Ash, tell Dallas Mother speculates that the noise is some kind of warning.
I'm going out after them.
I still think we should go after them.
How many.
Dallas, Lambert. Can you read me.
Okay.
Right here.
What happened to Kane. I need a clear definition.
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
We've already broken every rule or quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
I can't. If you were in my position you'd do the same.
I read you. The answer is negative.
Even if it's against the law.
Let's call it settled.
Somebody fill me in.
It doesn't make sense. It paralyzes him, puts him into a coma, then keeps him alive.
What's happening.
What about Kane.
What's the stain on his lungs.
What's happening.
I've got the toughest job on this ship...
I have to listen to your bullshit.
I'll get off your back when 12 module is fixed.
Anything new.
What about the Creature.
Plenty. What's it mean.
Is that why you let it in.
While Dallas and Kane are off the ship, I'm Senior Officer.
You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law.
You just broke it.
By breaking quarantine procedure you risk everybody's life.
This is your official position as a science officer. Not exactly out of the manual.
The door is closed. It must still be in there.
Yeah, I remember. We can't grab it. We can't kill it...
Yeah.
Where's its mouth.
Let's get rid of it.
That thing bled acid. God knows what it'll do when it's dead.
What about Kane.
I need some coffee.
How could you leave that kind of decision to him.
How does that happen.
Since when is that standard procedure.
Did you ship out with Ash before.
I don't trust him.
They're pretty much finished now.
There are still some thing left to do.
We're blind on B and C decks. Reserve power systems blown...
Is that a good idea.
Lock tractor beams.
Retract leading struts.
Everything holding together down there.
Whenever he says anything you say 'right'. You know that, Brett.
What do you think, Parker. Your staff just follows you around and says 'right'. Like a regular parrot.
Yeah. And so will we.
Christ.
What's the last thing you can remember.
We're on our way home.
What's wrong.
That means we've got another one.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running loose. We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers. We have to kill it first.
We have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
First we have to find it.
I've checked on the supplies. For about a week we can stay out of hypersleep.
All by yourselves.
There's another problem. How do we find it. There's no visual communication on B and C decks. All the screens are out.
Trap it somehow.
I thought I'd find you here.
We've got an hour...Look I need some relief.
Let me tell you something. You keep staring out there long enough, they'll be peeling you off the wall.
I'm tired of talking.
Give it a try anyway.
What's it key on.
Nothing.
Hold it. I've got something.
Machine's screwed up. I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
No, just confused. It's coming from below us.
Okay.
Back this way.
I thought you fixed 12 module.
Wait.
It's within five meters.
God damn it... hold it.
Go get it. We'll go on.
Nothing here.
No. At its present size it's holding enough acid to tear a hole in this ship as big as this room.
The only plan that's going to work is the same one we had before. Drive it into an air lock and blow it out into space.
The science department should be able to help...
Curious isn't it...That the Alien is an encephlepod...
It's curious because lower species can't adapt as quickly as higher ones. And this one's doing very well. A real survivor. Might even have as good a chance as we do.
All right. What about the temperature. What happens if we change it.
That's what worries me.
We didn't get him.
I'll go.
Air lock open.
Ready.
Read you clear.
Dallas...Dallas...
Oh my God.
This puts me in command.
Unless someone's got a better idea about dealing with the Alien, we'll continue with the last plan.
How are our weapons.
Get it.
Any ideas. From you or Mother.
You mean to tell me with everything we've got, we're still powerless against the Beast.
I can't believe that.
Go back to Mother and keep asking questions until you get some better answers.
Dallas didn't leave the master computer key with you.
No.
I know Ash has got the key.
He knows I want to check up on him...Without that key we've got no access to command priority information.
Did you ever sleep with Ash?
No.
Ripley.
Can't hear you... Repeat...
Parker...
Inner hatch sealed. The outer hatch is open.
I don't know. Take over.
You tell me.
I guess the alarm went off by itself.
Nobody's accusing you.
Go patch him up.
How much oxygen have we lost. I want an exact reading.
If I could find the command computer key, I could prove it.
You think I'm wrong.
Thanks.
Let's find out. Wire him back up.
Do it.
Ash let it on board. Ash let it grow inside Kane. Ash blew the warning signal.
Special Order 937.
That's what I want to know.
What is Special Order 937.
Then there's not point in talking to you. Pull the plug.
Why. Why not tell us.
They wanted to investigate the Alien. No matter what happened to us.
How do we kill it.
How.
No way.
We've had enough of your help.
Nice try, Ash.
Even if you have contempt for it.
Sorry Ash. I don't buy it.
He was conning us.
He wasn't protecting our human lives and that's all I care about. Anyway it's done.
He's right about one thing. We've got less than twelve hours oxygen left.
We're not there yet.
I think we should blow up the ship.
We leave in the shuttle and then blow up the ship.
That's all the oxygen.
Now. Let's get the food, shut off the engines and get out... Jones. Where's Jones.
Go look. We don't want to leave him.
I'll go. You load up the food.
Jones. You're in luck.
Come on, Jones.
God damn it, Jones. Come here.
Here kitty... come here kitty...
Parker. Lambert.
What did it do.
I'll get you out of there... We'll get up the autodoc.
What can I do.
Mother, I've turned all the cooling units back on.
I should reach the frontier in another five weeks. With a little luck the network will pick me up... This is Ripley, W564502460H, executive officer, last survivor of the commercial starship Nostromo signing off.
Come on cat.Thank you.
Oh... sorry.
Another dead end?
100 per cent chicken. Sorry.
Maybe... but we'd get that slob Purcell right where he lives.
Trevor thinks they're going to make him head of the anthropology department. It's unbelievable. His data is so secondhand...
And you and I are gonna nail him.
Hi honey.
That girl, is she alright? She wouldn't look at me and I swear she was blushing.
Bighead.
Any news on Purcell?
He got the job.
He makes my flesh crawl.
Hello...
Sure. Don't mind me.
You've heard of him?
Um... yes. What do you know about
him?
Cabrini Green?
Could I talk to your friend?
I'm Helen Buchanan.
Kitty... it may not seem much to you, but I'd really like to know...
Do you know her name?
She was shot?
Look...
That's not the half of it.
That's Cabrini Green, not that you'd recognize it now.
Look carefully at this picture... and then this one... spot it?
That's not Cabrini Green. That's this building... Sandburgh Village! My apartment was built as a housing project.
Once it was finished, the city soon realized that there was no barrier between here and the Gold Coast; no freeway or El Train to keep the ghetto cut off... So they did some minor alterations, clad the cinderblock in plaster and sold the lot off as condos.
Well they did. Come here...
Here's the proof.
It's all in the article about Ruthie Mae's murder... The killer, or killers, they don't know which, smashed his way through the back of the cabinet...
There's no wall there. One piece of plywood separating us from next door.
Look.
It's okay. The apartment's vacant.
What's wrong?
There can't be.
There's more. They even printed the address... Apartment 404 is where it all happened. We finally have a trail to follow...
Ready? Candyman!
Chicken...
What time is it?
What's with the arsenal? We're only going eight blocks.
I said dress smartly.
Let's stop and ask.
Building "Z"... this is it.
Let's go.
What d'you think's going to happen? They're going to shoot you? Rape you?
Then let's go.
With the cheeks of your ass stapled together.
Hi.
The walk sold it.
Hello... I'm sorry if I --.
Here it is...
Hello...
See... I was right. The layout is identical... This must be the bathroom...
What's the problem?
It's okay... there's nothing to see.
Wait a minute...
Alright...
Just help me up and as soon as I get back we'll be out of here.
It's just a derelict apartment.
You want to nail Purcell or not?
Help me up.
I promise I'll be quick.
Idiot.
Bernadette --.
I've got to go back... ran out of film...
Who --?
We're not cops. We're from the University.
I'm Helen Buchanan, and this is Bernadette Walsh. We're working on a thesis. We'd like to talk to you if you have the time...
No... Here... It'd only take five minutes...
Believe me, that's the last thing we'd want to do.
He's a beautiful boy.
What's his name?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Let me help.
No. I'd love one though.
Yes.
Who?
We're not ready.
Actually, Purcell, I think we're about to bury you.
How did you know that we'd traced the legend to Cabrini?
No.
Candyman...
Oh. Are you sure?
What's your name?
Listen, Jake, I'm Helen. Maybe you can help me. There are some things I need to know about the lady who got killed.
Do you kriow anything about that?
Her name was Ruthie Mae.
Didn't anyone talk about it?
Jake, it's okay to tell me. I'm not a cop. Nobody will get in trouble.
Candyman?
Are you scared of him?
I don't scare easy either, Jake. You don't have to tell me anything.
Just show me... show me where I can find Candyman. And I'll make a promise to you. It'll be our secret.
You sure you ain't scared?
Somebody building a bonfire?
Candyman is in there?
Who was it?
Crazy?
He was murdered?
Did Candyman do this?
Wait here.
Excuse me guys. I'm done here. I'll be out of your way.
I'm not interested in your business. I'm from the University of Illinois. I don't want to interfere, or cause you any kind of problem...
Don't touch me, asshole!!
You are not being smart. My colleagues know where I am. I am expected back. You fuck with me and so much heat will come down...
Number six.
How did you catch him?
Oh.
What about the boy, Jake?
I wanted to thank you Jake... for saving my life.
It is Jake. You don't have to go to court.
Candyman isn't real. It's just a story. Like Frankenstein or Dracula. A bad guy took his name to scare you. He's locked up now and everything will be alright.
I feel much better.
You've already eaten?
You sure you don't want desert?
Don't worry, it'll keep. That's not what I was thinking.
The look on that kid's face when I told him that Candyman didn't exist. It was like he just found out the truth about Santa Claus.
You know what bothers me about the whole thing? Two people get brutally murdered, and the cops do nothing. A white woman gets attacked and they lock the place down. Kind of shows their priorities, eh?
The photos?
I'd written them off, the camera was so smashed...
We did it, didn't we?
See you there.
Yes?
Do I know you?
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I'm late ...
No! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Calm down!!
Wha-
Could I shower?
I want to speak to Detective Valento.
Frank... I have to talk to you...
Please, let me explain...
Yes, but listen --.
This is crazy. I was attacked.
r understand... look, Frank, he came after me, he's trying to kill me...
I... I --.
I... I want to make a phone call.
Trevor... are you there? ... Pick up!
It's three a.m., where is he?
Do you think I did it?
But it's crossed your mind.
I saw him... he threatened me and I blacked out. I... I don't know what happened. When I woke up I was in that place... and there was blood everywhere...
I think he's trying to destroy me...
No, it's okay.
Trevor...
Where were you last night?
I needed you and you weren't there.
You promise?
You go. I'll be fine.
Proof... I need proof...
Get out of my house!
What do you think?
Keep away from me!!
No.
Oh God... no... no...
Get out of here!! Run!! He's here!!
GET OUT OF HERE!!! NOW!!!
NOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!
Trevor... he's here... he's here...
Don't let him kill me.
Trevor...
Trevor...
What --?
Get off me...
Trevor...
Where are we going?
Hold me Trevor. Hold me.
He's going to kill the baby.
He's going to kill the baby.
Trevor!
Trevor!
Hey! What is this!!?
Stop!!
You can't do this!!! He'll come for me!!!
I can't defend myself!!!
HE'S HERE!! HELP ME!!
SOMEBODY HELF ME!!!!
GET OFF ME!!!
MURDERER!!!
I will destroy you. You are evil.
HE'S HERE!!! HE'S HERE!!!
HELF ME!!! HE'S UNDER THE BED!!!
I want to speak to my husband...
How long have I been out?
I want to see my husband.
What?! Have I been sectioned? How long have I been here?
A month?!
Get me my attorney.
That's absurd!
He broke in... through the medicine cabinet.
...poor Bernadette...
That's wrong. I saw him. I...
I am not hallucinating.
Yes.
HE'S HERE! HELF ME!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
I killed my best friend... she trusted me... she loved me... I cut her open... I... it's not possible... it's...
Whatever is happening to me... whatever is going wrong, I know one thing. I am not capable of that. No part of me, however hidden, could do that...
I can prove it.
I can call him.
Candyman...
Be home, Trevor... please be home...
Get out of my home.
I live here. Remember?
Don't touch that!
Scared of something, Trevor?
I hate the color scheme.
What were you going to do Trevor? Wait till I got out before you told me?
You knew I was never coming out. Didn't you?
If that's what you want, go on, do it.
I'm not a murderer... I'm not... You're all I had left... it's over...
Never...
The child... we had a deal.
No... wait... please...
I'm afraid.
Both...
I don't want to be remembered that way. I want to be forgotten...
Noooooo!!!! Noooooo!!!!
Stop...
It was always you...
It's okay... I'm here... it's okay...
HELP ME!!! GOD HELP ME!!!
You promised me...
We made a deal...
See her! See her face!! You lied to me!!
Let me go!!
We made a deal!!
No!
Out of the eater came forth meat... Out of the strong came forth sweetness. I came for you.

Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
Don't beat him up too bad, he's kinda cute.
Huh? Yeah, what?
What's it to ya?
Yeah? How would you know?
Maybe he was telling the truth.
I can think of only one thing even more terrifying.
...And then after that we'll swim, hike, and have lots of fun together. Okay?
...And you're the child...
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
Kinda hard to see it from this angle? Got a mirror?
Now tell me, "If your mother was alive, you wouldn't..."
Sheriff's office...
...Can you hold on? He's in the can draining his lizard.
...Oh, here he comes now...
...Daddy, it's Rick.
What it is?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Sheriff's office...
...No, I'm sorry, he's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
...Oh, hi. I'm Megan, his daughter. Remember, I met you this morning...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible. If he finds you, he'll...
It's the only way. My father will nail you in your car in a second...
...Where are you?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Then let's get goin'. We can argue on the way. You tell me what you need...
...I'll make sure you get in.
...And nobody drives this baby but me...
You got it. Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Get down.
Please don't do anything crazy.
I know what I'm doing. I got your supplies for ya, didn't I?... Now if I can get to Cunningham Road, I can lose them...
...Just stay where you are.
This is gonna be a hairy turn. Grab ahold of something.
It's all over.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
What?... What happened?!
Daddy, what is going on?
Tell me!!
No. No, it's not...
Dad... What time were they murdered?
I was with Tommy all that time.
There... Ya happy?
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Give it to me, punk.
Let him out of there.
I ain't the one with the funny red nose...Open the cell and exchange places...with him...
...Now.
Yeah, something like that.
No, he took 'em...But I got my Hide-a-Key.
Wait a minute. I just...
Well, come on, hot lips, let's go. You drive, I'll navigate.
Let me know when you're about to blast into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seat belt.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Lake Forest Green?
They did show up. Isn't that great?
Dad!... Daddy!!
It's okay. It's me - Megan. Don't be afraid.
It's all right. Shhh-hh.
Now I gotta find my daddy, the sheriff, so we can all go home. Okay?
So you stay here and we'll be back to get you. Everyone lie back down and don't worry.
Oh, God! Oh my God!
Dad! Answer me! Daddy, where are you! Help us!
You gotta help me look for him... We need him to help us.
Did you hear me?!
You're gonna be sorry.
No. Don't leave.
Tommy, get out of there! Row to the other side of the lake! Hurry!!
Stay here.

He's nuts about you.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Worked like a charm.
Nice to have a fire.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
See? You've forgotten the bad dream. Didn't I tell you?
Fingernails?
That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of ...obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
He scraped his fingernails along things -- actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose -- sssssccrrrtttt....
I didn't hear anything...
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.
Rod...
We should get her out of here...
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
But I just don't feel... ready to sleep yet. Please, do I have to?
He means, did you ever drop me on my head.
I don't see why you couldn't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming...
No.
It's not you I don't trust. It's...
Okay. Let's do it.
No. That's enough sleep.
You believe this?
I grabbed it off his head.
Go even crazier?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
His name is even in it -- written right in here -- Fred Krueger -- Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mamma? You better tell me, cause now he's after me!
You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you -- avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded --
You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up!
Screw sleep!
That's enough!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
No.
Yeah.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
Great.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I'm into survival.
Oh gross...
Mom, what's with the bars!?
Oh, Mom...
What's with the bars?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
So he's alive?
What did you do, mother?
Go on...
Who was there? Were Tina's parents there? Were Rod's?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Hi.
Fine. Stand by your window so I can see you. You sound a million miles away.
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.
The killer.
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
My dream.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Okay.
Night-night.
Hang on GLEN...
Glen. Don't fall asleep...
Glen?
Brilliant. Now what if Glen calls?
Hello?
I'm awake, I am awake. This is not a dream! I am --.
My boyfriend...!
Give me the key, mother.
GLEEENNNNNN!
Glen!! Don't fall asleeeeeep!
Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
You know he's dead though, right?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Deal.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Come out and show yourself you bastard.
I'm crazy after all...
Help! Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped! Where are you!?
Get my father, you asshole!
Daddy! Where are you!
Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!
Come on -- he's in here! Daddy! Don't let him kill me too!
HEELLLPPP!!! Daddyyyyyyy!!!!
Hey -- Daddy! Hey! I got the bastard!
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!
He's after Mom! Come on!
He's under there! Watch it!
Now do you believe me?
I know you're there, Krueger.
I know you too well now, Freddie.
It's too late, Krueger. I know the secret now -- this is just a dream, too -- you're not alive -- the whole thing is a dream -- so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.
I take back every bit of energy I ever gave you. You're nothing. You're shit.
God, it's bright.
Feeling better?
Nah. Just slept heavy.
See ya.

Hello?
Hello?
Yes?
Who is this?
Cory Gillis. 442-8730.
Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M...
Enjoy the movie.
Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek.
Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?
What murders?
What's going on?
What's going on, Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Yeah, right.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
No PDA.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Thanks, Joel.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie.
Hello, Gale.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
My morn was a Delta.
Randy? What are you doing here?
Cotton...
What are you doing?
You BITCH!
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
Any news?
The forbidden subject.
It's starting all over again.
I'll get my jacket.
Hello?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Then come and get me.
Derek. He's in the house. Help... me...
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
This is exactly what I don't want.
But...
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Shit. Did I?
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
Wanna get outta here?
Yeah.
Cotton.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that?
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Did it?
What?
I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
No, it's not.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
I'm sorry, Derek.
Excuse me? Did your computer just freeze?
I'm not signed on.
He's here. He's in the room right now.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Someone else has been killed.
I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break
I'd really just like to be alone.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
But who would operate your camera?
He's cool, Remy.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Whatever.
Where are you taking me?
I feel like Eddie Murphy.
SOMEBODY PLEASE OPEN UP SOMEBODY!
Oh God, help me. We have to call the police.
Do you have keys? I need to get inside.
Shit!
Mickey? Mickey?
Oh God, no, Mickey...
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
He's after me.
I'll be right back.
Watch out.
Don't panic.
Watch out.
Hey.
Hallie?
Hello?
Hallie?
No. This is a set up.
Why?
You're not going to get away with this.
Gale!
Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live.
But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos...
Mrs. Loomis?
Oh my God.
Why Mrs. Loomis?
You'll never get away with this.
NOOO!
Please, Cotton, don't do this.
It's over, Cotton.
