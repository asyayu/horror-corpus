<l>You're so predictable.</l>
<l>What the --.</l>
<l>I'm sixteen, Keri. I should be
able to live wherever I want.</l>
<l>Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom.
Now can I move into the dorms?</l>
<l>Well, Dad thinks it's okay.</l>
<l>I promise not to run off to Cancun.</l>
<l>The dorms are only fifty feet
away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make?</l>
<l>All right, I was wrong. There is
a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.</l>
<l>My life is a living hell.</l>
<l>To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?</l>
<l>You're twisted.</l>
<l>There you are.</l>
<l>You tell 'em about tonight?</l>
<l>Shelve the barf bag. It's the key
to the main gate.</l>
<l>Swiped it from my mom's desk
yesterday.</l>
<l>I borrowed it.</l>
<l>I am in need of some serious
partying.</l>
<l>Why not?</l>
<l>Molly, you're the resident
assistant. What are you gonna do, narc on yourself?</l>
<l>Just meet me in front of the gate
after lights out.</l>
<l>Don't worry... I hear he only
kills virgins.</l>
<l>Condoms are on aisle four...</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>I just went for a walk. It's no
big deal.</l>
<l>Or what? You're gonna shoot me?</l>
<l>Well, maybe if you'd let me live
in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.</l>
<l>Just forget it...</l>
<l>Nah, I didn't tell her where I
went.</l>
<l>I came to see you.</l>
<l>Can I come in?</l>
<l>Then you come out here.</l>
<l>Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.</l>
<l>You saw that Michael Meyers
display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.</l>
<l>You look kind of cold.</l>
<l>Here, take my jacket.</l>
<l>Better?</l>
<l>That was classic... "Michael, nooooooo!"</l>
<l>I'm sorry, all right? It was just
a stupid joke.</l>
<l>You some kind of fugitive or
something?</l>
<l>Now you're joking, right?</l>
<l>Wait a minute... slow down...
you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?</l>
<l>Any other psychotic relatives I
should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?</l>
<l>Why didn't you tell me?</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>He found you, didn't he?</l>
<l>Where's Molly? She's not in her room...</l>
<l>I'm not leaving without her.</l>
<l>What? Where is she?</l>
<l>Oh, God... no... not Molly.</l>
<l>I just can't believe she's dead.</l>
<l>Yeah, me too, Keri.</l>
<l>Keri.... Laurie... how about if I
just call you Mom?</l>
