<l>You didn't have to come, Hawes...</l>
<l>This is between me and Jason.</l>
<l>Seeing it won't. But destroying
him once and for all will.
Jason belongs in hell.</l>
<l>I'm gonna see he gets there.</l>
<l>You bastard!</l>
<l>Yeah. Fuck you, Jason.</l>
<l>Don't shoot. Please.</l>
<l>You gotta do somethingl
Jason's alivel He killed my
friend, now he's coming for mell</l>
<l>Will you listen, dammit!</l>
<l>Jason is alive. We dug up
his body. I was gonna cremate
it and...</l>
<l>Tommy Jarvis. We gotta do
something. He's even more
powerful now that ...</l>
<l>Yeah. Jason murdered them and...</l>
<l>Yes, but they released me
because ...</l>
<l>There's no time for this
bullshit ...</l>
<l>Jason's got to be stopped.</l>
<l>No ... Ya gotta listen. Jason's
coming back here. He's after
me. I tried to destroy him
but I fucked up ...</l>
<l>Why didn't you cremate him?l</l>
<l>If you'd just go to the
cemetery, you'll see I'm
not lying.</l>
<l>You're gonna be sorry you
didn't listen to me.</l>
<l>I got a bad feeling of what
might've happened to them.</l>
<l>You've got to convince the
sheriff to look for your
friends. Hopefully, they're
fine. But there's a very
good chance that Jason ...</l>
<l>I'm not dangerous, believe me.
Jason is out there. He's
looking for me. But there's
every possibility he'll
return to the camp where
it all started.</l>
<l>Yes!</l>
<l>But they have to be warned,
Sheriff. Jason will return
to the area that's familiar.
No matter what you call it,
it's still Camp Crystal Lake
to him.</l>
<l>I gotta show you Jason's grave.</l>
<l>Please, Sheriff. You'll see
we dug it up.</l>
<l>That's not right. Somebody
covered it up ...</l>
<l>... I gotta see it ...</l>
<l>Who covered up Jason's grave?!</l>
<l>Jason's not in his coffin!
Hawes is! Dig it up! You
gotta dig it up!!</l>
<l>Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got
to talk to your dad. About
Jason. I've got a plan. I
need to buy some things first,
but mainly need help to ...</l>
<l>I already have a very good
idea what could've happened ...</l>
<l>... Megan, Jason is out there.
He has to be stopped. I'm
positive he's heading back
to the lake area. He'll
keep killing until ...</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Uh ... Howie's Service Station
and Feed Bag Stop. I think it's ...</l>
<l>I'm gonna borrow your car.
You can't do this with me.
It's much too dangerous.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.
I'm already responsible
for causing the death of ...</l>
<l>Uh... yes. But ...</l>
<l>Can this tub go any faster?</l>
<l>Okay. There's one.</l>
<l>Please don't do anything
crazy.</l>
<l>Whatever you say.</l>
<l>It's just beginning.</l>
<l>You got me where you want me.
There's no reason not...</l>
<l>Doesn't that tell you
something?!</l>
<l>Jason did do it. I swear!
Sheriff, when were they
murdered?</l>
<l>Damn.</l>
<l>So what are ya drawin'?</l>
<l>I was just curious about
what she was drawin'.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>'Cause it stinks.</l>
<l>Come and get it.</l>
<l>Better do as she says, 'cause
... wherever the red dot goes,
a bullet is sure to follow.</l>
<l>Got the keys?</l>
<l>Sorry, Megan. Not this time.</l>
<l>I thank you for getting me
out. But I gotta finish
what I started.</l>
<l>I got a bad feeling we're
already too late.</l>
<l>It probably wouldn't have
any effect on him. The
only sure way to stop
Jason is to return him
to his original resting
place, where he drowned
in 1957.</l>
<l>Crystal Lake.~.where the
nightmare began.</l>
<l>I hope so.</l>
<l>Megan, wait!</l>
<l>No, Meganl</l>
<l>Megan! Use your dad's car
radio and call for assistance
... and an ambulance!</l>
<l>Whew ... Okay, hand me
those padlocks.</l>
<l>Yes. And I said, hand me tose padlocks.</l>
<l>I hope not.</l>
<l>Megan! Get back into the
cabin with the kids.</l>
<l>Megan, please!</l>
<l>Megan, get in there with
them before it's too late.</l>
<l>Megan!</l>
<l>JASON!!</l>
<l>Come on, Jason! It's
me you want! Come and
get me!!</l>
<l>That's it! Come on, pus-head!</l>
<l>Hey, asshole! It's me you
want, remember?! Come on,
chickenshit, I'm sittin'
here waitin' !</l>
<l>It's over, Megan. It's
finally over. Jason is home.</l>
