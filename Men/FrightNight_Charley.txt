<l>Forget Peter Vincent.</l>
<l>I love you more --.</l>
<l>Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've
been going together almost a year and
all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"'</l>
<l>I'm sorry, Amy.</l>
<l>You mean it?</l>
<l>Amy, you're not going to believe this,
but there are two guys in the yard
below. And I think they're carrying a
coffin.</l>
<l>Amy, I'm serious.</l>
<l>Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to
see this.</l>
<l>AMY --.</l>
<l>Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin, but I
did see two guys carrying something
into that house --.</l>
<l>No, Mom, nothing like that.</l>
<l>Mom, we're in high school.</l>
<l>Yeah, goodnight.</l>
<l>Mom, there are people. next door.</l>
<l>What new owner?</l>
<l>To who?</l>
<l>The bastard. Why didn't he tell us he
was going to spring a pop quiz?</l>
<l>Hey, Amy --.</l>
<l>Buzz off, Evil.</l>
<l>No, next door.</l>
<l>Mom, you seen the new guy next door
yet?</l>
<l>No, i don't think so.</l>
<l>Ah, nothing. Got to study. See you
later.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>It was?</l>
<l>Look, Amy, I. love you. I never.. want to
fight with you again, okay?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>You're sick.(staring at him).</l>
<l>Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't
believe what s happening next door.</l>
<l>He has fangs. The man who bought the
house has fanas!</l>
<l>Mom, I don't need hot cocoa. I didn't
have a nightmare. They did kill a girl
over there.</l>
<l>Mom, I'm not sick. The guy did have fangs and a bat did fly over my head and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of
the shadows. You know what that means,
don't you?</l>
<l>He's a vampire!</l>
<l>A vampire, damnit! Haven't you
listened to anything I've said?</l>
<l>Forget it, I'm going to the police.</l>
<l>All right, then I won't tell them it's
a vampire. But I sure as hell am going
to tell them about the two women --.</l>
<l>That's a lie.</l>
<l>I saw him carry her body out in a
plastic bag. What do you say to that, Mr. Cole?</l>
<l>The bag I saw had a body in it, not
trash.</l>
<l>No, but --.</l>
<l>Look, I can prove he's lying. Let's
look in the basement instead.</l>
<l>A coffin, that's what's down there, a
coffin. I saw them carry it in!</l>
<l>Lieutenant Lennox, please, listen to me--.</l>
<l>Evil!</l>
<l>The vampire knows that I know about
him. Or at least he will when he wakes
up tonight.</l>
<l>I've got a vampire living next door and
he's going to kill me if I don't
protect myself.</l>
<l>Look, Evil, I haven't got time to
explain. Just tell me what to do to protect myself.</l>
<l>I'm not kidding. Evil, please, just
tell me what to do.</l>
<l>Look, I've got eight bucks. Tell me
what' to do and it's yours.</l>
<l>In my bedroom. Tonight.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>That's all?</l>
<l>You sure about that?</l>
<l>Yeah, Mom --.</l>
<l>What's he doing here?</l>
<l>You what?</l>
<l>Yeah, fine. I've just got to get back
to my trigonometry, that's all.</l>
<l>The vampire is in the house. My
idiot mother just invited him over
for a drink.</l>
<l>Ed, this is serious!</l>
<l>Yeah, and I nailed my window shut.</l>
<l>You sure?</l>
<l>I, I just had a nightmare.</l>
<l>Nothing, Mom. Just the raccoons in the
garbage again. Why don't you go back
to sleep.</l>
<l>I'm fine now, honest. Night.</l>
<l>Get him, Peter, get him --.</l>
<l>Hey, Mr. Vincent --.</l>
<l>Could I talk to you a minute?</l>
<l>Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly
important.</l>
<l>Pardon me?</l>
<l>No, sir. I was curious about what you
said last night on TV. You know, about
believing in vampires.</l>
<l>Were you serious?</l>
<l>What do you mean?</l>
<l>I believe in vampires.</l>
<l>In fact I have one living next door.
Would you help me kill him ?</l>
<l>You know the murder of that girl that
happened yesterday?</l>
<l>Well, the'guy who lives next door did
it and he's a vampire.</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent, I'm not joking. I'm
deadly serious.</l>
<l>But, Mr. Vincent, I'm telling the
TRUTH --.</l>
<l>You just said you believe in
VAMPIRES --.</l>
<l>Please, you have to listen to me. The
vampire tried to kill me last night - and
trashed my car when he didn't
succeed. He'll be coming back for me
tonight and if I don't get help, he's
going to kill me --.</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent, you've got to believe me --.</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent--.</l>
<l>Self-defense. Not that I think
I'll need it. He'll be dead before
nightfall.</l>
<l>Dandrige. I'm waiting for the guy he
lives with to leave, then I'm doing
to go next door, find his coffin, and
pound this through his heart.</l>
<l>You can't murder a vampire, Amy.
They're already dead, remember.</l>
<l>I don't have any choice, Amy. The
police won't listen to me, my mother
thinks I'm crazy, you two, even Peter
Vincent thinks I'm nuts.</l>
<l>See. After he attacked me last night
he went out and had his dinner.</l>
<l>No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody
has to stop him. Hold on, I need
ANOTHER STAKE.</l>
<l>I told you, I already tried him.</l>
<l>Why should he believe you anymore than
he did me?</l>
<l>Fat chance.</l>
<l>I don't know --.</l>
<l>No, you're right there.</l>
<l>All right, try him again..</l>
<l>AMY --.</l>
<l>You don't believe me, do you?</l>
<l>Who is it?</l>
<l>He did. When?</l>
<l>But Dandrige will be out of his coffin
by then.</l>
<l>I don't know. Maybe he didn't take it</l>
<l>Honest?</l>
<l>Then maybe we it really have a chance
to kill Dandrige tomorrow night.</l>
<l>You two don't know what it's been like,
knowing there's a vampire living next
door and having no one believe me --.</l>
<l>It's six ten. He said he'd be here at
six, right?</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this --.</l>
<l>There.</l>
<l>Where're your stakes and hammer?</l>
<l>But I know he's a vampire.</l>
<l>You're not going in there without them?</l>
<l>He did?</l>
<l>But, Mr. Vincent, if I'm right and
you prove he's a vampire, he'll kill
us all right then and there.</l>
<l>But, Mr. Vincent, you don't know how
powerful he is. He can change into a
bat and fly through the night --.</l>
<l>BUT -- Billy Cole opens the door, his face lighting up when he
sees Peter. He shakes his hand warmly.</l>
<l>Where do you keep your coffin? Or do
you have more than one?</l>
<l>Damn right, I did; Only the cops didn't believe me anymore than any of
you.</l>
<l>But you'll believe me in a few
seconds. Mr. Vincent, give him the
holy water.</l>
<l>Get ready to run. I'll protect you
with this.</l>
<l>But, it can't be --.</l>
<l>Then it wasn't blessed!</l>
<l>If he's not a vampire, then have him
touch this?</l>
<l>No, no, of course not.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>C'mon, let's get out of here --.</l>
<l>What's wrong with you?</l>
<l>Then why are your hands shaking?</l>
<l>You saw something in there, didn't
you, something that convinced you he
was a vampire?</l>
<l>Is Jerry Dandrige a vampire or not?</l>
<l>Please, Mr. Vincent, you have to tell
me. Our lives depend on it.</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent, you have to call the Police - and tell them --</l>
<l>SHIT!</l>
<l>Well, at least you two heard him.</l>
<l>Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had
no reflection.</l>
<l>you, Amy? Remember the way he looked
at you?</l>
<l>Where are you going?</l>
<l>Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first.</l>
<l>Because it's after dark, pencil.dick,
and there's a vampire back there!</l>
<l>No way. We want people and lights,
the more the better.</l>
<l>What if you're wrong, Evil? What if
Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks
you know it. Would you walk down
that alley then?</l>
<l>Ed, please, just stick with us.</l>
<l>Let him go. No vampire's gonna want
hint anyway.. Probably give him blood
poisoning.</l>
<l>Where is he?</l>
<l>Ed, Ed, are you all right?</l>
<l>Jesus, I warned him --.</l>
<l>You asshole, you fucking asshole!</l>
<l>You'll get yours someday, Evil.</l>
<l>How much further?</l>
<l>What was that?</l>
<l>Amy, what if Evil really was in
trouble?</l>
<l>Don't tell me it's a power outage.</l>
<l>I think we lost him.</l>
<l>It's all right, Amy.</l>
<l>We've got it made.</l>
<l>Run?</l>
<l>Over here --.</l>
<l>HERE --.</l>
<l>Eighteen.</l>
<l>The police.</l>
<l>Yeah, give me Lieutenant Lennox.</l>
<l>He doesn't believe me.</l>
<l>I won't let him get you, Amy. I
promise.</l>
<l>She can't handle this, Amy.</l>
<l>We don't have any choice, Amy. Now
give me his number.</l>
<l>C'mon; Mr, Vincent, answer, please,
answer.</l>
<l>Answer me, damnit, answer me --.</l>
<l>Mr. Vincent, this is Charley Brewster.
You gotta help us. Jerry Dandrige has
me and Amy trapped in this club --.</l>
<l>But you have to come, Mr. Vincent.
You're the only one who knows what's
going on.</l>
<l>If you don't, Dandrige'll kill us!</l>
<l>God damn him. He-won't help us --.</l>
<l>Pardon me, have you seen a girl, light-haired --.</l>
<l>I'm looking for a girl --.</l>
<l>Let her go!</l>
<l>You filthy son-of-a-bitch -- !</l>
<l>You can't kill me here --.</l>
<l>Let me go --.</l>
<l>That's her, over there with that older guy.</l>
<l>C'mon, quick --.</l>
<l>Hold on to me --.</l>
<l>Amy!</l>
<l>Charley Brewster. Let me in.</l>
<l>What are you talking about?</l>
<l>What are you, doing?</l>
<l>You can't.</l>
<l>No, they won't believe you. I've
tried.</l>
<l>Peter, it's just us. Were going to
have to save Amy.</l>
<l>I know.</l>
<l>Yes. You're Peter Vincent, the Great
Vampire Killer.</l>
<l>I can't do it alone, Peter. If you
don't help, Amy's going to die. And
me, too, probably.</l>
<l>Please, Peter.</l>
<l>Yeah, me, too.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Peter, this is serious.</l>
<l>What about Billy Cole? What's going
to stop him?</l>
<l>What if he's not human? Bullets
aren't going to stop him then.</l>
<l>Peter --.</l>
<l>What's wrong?</l>
<l>Too late.</l>
<l>This way.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Amy'll be dead by then, too. Now come on.</l>
<l>Where's Amy?</l>
<l>Stop!</l>
<l>We're gonna make. it --</l>
<l>AMY --.</l>
<l>What have you done to her?</l>
<l>You bastard!</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>Peter?</l>
<l>Help, let me out!</l>
<l>We can't. Look.</l>
<l>Is it too late to save her?</l>
<l>Are you sure?</l>
<l>Let's go --.</l>
<l>Come on, we have him --.</l>
<l>What did he mean?</l>
<l>He wasn't human.</l>
<l>Peter!</l>
<l>She's worse. C'mon, we're running
out of time --.</l>
<l>Where is he?</l>
<l>Well, he was here --.</l>
<l>God' damn him. Where is he?</l>
<l>Yeah, but what's he doing up there?</l>
<l>I'm going up there.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Peter, behind you!</l>
<l>You okay?</l>
<l>Amy --.</l>
<l>Oh, my God --.</l>
<l>He's downstairs now --.</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>Come on --.</l>
<l>What is it?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Well, now we know what he did with
the mirrors --.</l>
<l>You keep searching. I'll check it
out.</l>
<l>Who's there --.</l>
<l>Amy --.</l>
<l>Get it open!</l>
