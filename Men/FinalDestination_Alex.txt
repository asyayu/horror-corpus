<l>Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.</l>
<l>I will. Don't worry.</l>
<l>Fuck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time?</l>
<l>Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.</l>
<l>John Denver...</l>
<l>He died in a plane crash.</l>
<l>C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?</l>
<l>Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE!</l>
<l>We have to get out!</l>
<l>We have to get off this plane!</l>
<l>Now! NOW!!</l>
<l>I'm not joking! I'm not joking!</l>
<l>Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!</l>
<l>Fuck you! I'll remove myself!</l>
<l>I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground...</l>
<l>And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.</l>
<l>Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital.</l>
<l>I wish you were on the plane!</l>
<l>You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this.</l>
<l>How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...</l>
<l>I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...</l>
<l>No. I saw it. I saw it!</l>
<l>Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight...</l>
<l>I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before...</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>Because... I... never thought it would really happen.</l>
<l>I don't.</l>
<l>Then maybe you should lay off the J.D.</l>
<l>Not here, not now. Not EVER!</l>
<l>Ms. Lewton...</l>
<l>I don't want to sound gay, or nothin', but... I miss you.</l>
<l>That's a plan.</l>
<l>What happened? Is Tod alright?</l>
<l>What... what happened?</l>
<l>Mr. Waggner...</l>
<l>He wouldn't do it!</l>
<l>He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself?</l>
<l>It's only the end of June.</l>
<l>Like, um... you're mad about something?</l>
<l>You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.</l>
<l>Why were you there last night?</l>
<l>Why were you there last night?</l>
<l>I'm... really sorry.</l>
<l>I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.</l>
<l>What if Tod... is just the first... of us?</l>
<l>I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.</l>
<l>This place?!</l>
<l>That... him?</l>
<l>That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone.</l>
<l>Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're
not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!</l>
<l>Why..?</l>
<l>I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...</l>
<l>What are all those tiny marks?</l>
<l>Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?</l>
<l>His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.</l>
<l>You saying Tod did kill himself?</l>
<l>Design?</l>
<l>Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game?</l>
<l>I'm sorry we broke in.</l>
<l>Yeah, we did.</l>
<l>He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.</l>
<l>How many died on Flight 180? From our group?</l>
<l>Remember the gate number?</l>
<l>Thirty-nine.</l>
<l>Remember the departure time?</l>
<l>Do you know when I was born?</l>
<l>Right. April 25th.</l>
<l>My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!?</l>
<l>I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.</l>
<l>Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.</l>
<l>You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you.</l>
<l>No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.</l>
<l>The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it.</l>
<l>But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still (beat).die; now, not later.</l>
<l>Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again.</l>
<l>Then there's no one left who can help me.</l>
<l>This'll be hard to believe.</l>
<l>Listen to me, we may all be in danger...</l>
<l>Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it.</l>
<l>That's Tod's seat...</l>
<l>The path of the explosion... That's Death's design.</l>
<l>Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.</l>
<l>I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.</l>
<l>Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.</l>
<l>I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.</l>
<l>I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer.</l>
<l>This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone.</l>
<l>And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.</l>
<l>No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.</l>
<l>Ms. Lewton!</l>
<l>Ms. Lewton!</l>
<l>Are they up there?</l>
<l>Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe?</l>
<l>Most kids do, I guess.</l>
<l>This won't be safe.</l>
<l>No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.</l>
<l>I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.</l>
<l>Why do you think I was hiding?</l>
<l>They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...</l>
<l>I already told you...</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible.</l>
<l>Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.</l>
<l>It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.</l>
<l>Carter, stop it, you fuckin' maniac!!</l>
<l>Let us out!</l>
<l>Billy, get out!</l>
<l>Easy, Billy, just open it.</l>
<l>Don't do it! Don't do it!</l>
<l>Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car!</l>
<l>You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.</l>
<l>But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.</l>
<l>That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.</l>
<l>My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.</l>
<l>Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!</l>
<l>After Billy... it's me. And then you.</l>
<l>Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.</l>
<l>Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.</l>
<l>I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!</l>
<l>I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine...</l>
<l>She's next.</l>
<l>Don't move!</l>
<l>You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.</l>
<l>NO!</l>
<l>You know what to do.</l>
<l>When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.</l>
<l>You know what to do. I'll always be with you.</l>
<l>NO!</l>
<d>(beat).</d>
<d>(beat).</d>
<d>(beat).</d>

<d>(beat).</d>

<d>(quietly).</d>
