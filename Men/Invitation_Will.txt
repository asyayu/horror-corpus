<l>Sorry.</l>
<l>I’m back.</l>
<l>No, it’s okay. It’s just going to
have to be okay.</l>
<l>I’ll be fine.</l>
<l>Tommy and Miguel... everybody else
you’ll meet. All my old friends. I
guess that’s the point. Getting
everybody back together.</l>
<l>Maybe they’re overcompensating.
Tough to just call people up after
two years.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>I mean, I ran into her once. I saw
her and David going into the
supermarket together. I couldn’t
deal. I just sat in the car until
they left. A little bit after that,
I heard she just disappeared.</l>
<l>Yeah, while we were still married.
She loved it. I couldn’t stand it.</l>
<l>Somebody’s bawling while you feel
fine. Someone’s passing out cookies
while you’re coming apart. It just
made me angry.</l>
<l>I didn’t want anyone’s help.</l>
<l>You could’ve put odds on our
divorce, I guess.</l>
<l>Yes they do.</l>
<l>Though this is just the kind of
thing she’d...</l>
<l>Jesus!</l>
<l>I don’t know. Animal.</l>
<l>Stay here.</l>
<l>Don’t come up here.</l>
<l>We can’t leave it like this.</l>
<l>Just go back to the car, okay?</l>
<l>How the fuck can she go back to
that house?</l>
<l>And I’m not.</l>
<l>I don’t think things work that way.</l>
<l>Lot of money in Eden’s family.</l>
<l>Wasn’t ever mine.</l>
<l>I look like a dirty dishrag?</l>
<l>It never thrived.</l>
<l>Where’s Choi?</l>
<l>Is Eden...?</l>
<l>Me too.</l>
<l>No. Not really.</l>
<l>Of course. Sure.</l>
<l>Hey. How are you?</l>
<l>What does that mean?</l>
<l>It’s not...</l>
<l>A tire iron.</l>
<l>Mind if I look around?</l>
<l>Eden?</l>
<l>Eden!</l>
<l>Christ...</l>
<l>Sorry. You scared me.</l>
<l>These bars on the windows are new.</l>
<l>That’s nice.</l>
<l>Is that where you were for the last
two years?</l>
<l>Yeah. I did.</l>
<l>It’s not hard for you to be in this
house again?</l>
<l>You look different.</l>
<l>What are you talking about?</l>
<l>Eden.</l>
<l>Has she been like this the whole
night?</l>
<l>She’s like a different person.</l>
<l>I didn’t?</l>
<l>What? Really?</l>
<l>I don’t know. I don’t really know
how to act.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Where’s Amanda?</l>
<l>How are Robbie and Lucia?</l>
<l>What’s up?</l>
<l>That’s not good.</l>
<l>It’s good to see you.</l>
<l>Okay. How’s work? You’re up for
tenure, right?</l>
<l>A year ago. Really.</l>
<l>I’m sorry. About...</l>
<l>I don’t know why anyone would call
your teachings gloomy.</l>
<l>I don’t know.</l>
<l>Why don’t you just leave the key in
the door? It’s like a fortress in
here.</l>
<l>I never heard about that.</l>
<l>What if there was a fire?</l>
<l>You’re very dirty there.</l>
<l>Yes. Attention to detail is
incredibly important.</l>
<l>It is my credo.</l>
<l>Why don’t you go back to bed,
buddy? We’ll be quieter.</l>
<l>So that’ll be the time he saw his
gross parents having sex.</l>
<l>He could probably use one</l>
<l>I just don’t understand why you’d
show something like this at a
dinner party.</l>
<l>Don’t. Just don’t.</l>
<l>I know.</l>
<l>Yeah...</l>
<l>It’s all right.</l>
<l>Sorry, I...</l>
<l>Thanks. I know. I miss you.</l>
<l>Nope.</l>
<l>Hey Miguel. Can you tell what this
is?</l>
<l>Seriously. I found a bunch of it in
Eden’s bedroom... unlabeled.</l>
<l>Come on, just look at it.</l>
<l>Is that dangerous?</l>
<l>Let’s just drop it.</l>
<l>Not much new to report.</l>
<l>I just meant that...</l>
<l>No. Not at all.</l>
<l>Why?</l>
<l>Thank you.</l>
<l>Am I alone here? This is odd, isn’t
it?</l>
<l>I’m not kidding.</l>
<l>They don’t seem right to me.</l>
<l>Just let her go, David. Why can’t
she just leave?</l>
<l>Just let her do what she wants.</l>
<l>I’m good.</l>
<l>You want me to walk you out?</l>
<l>I’ll be there in one second.</l>
<l>Sure.</l>
<l>You chose us?</l>
<l>I’m sorry you feel that way.
Maybe... I wasn’t prepared to be
here.</l>
<l>David, please. Please.</l>
<l>I don’t pretend to know what you
went through with your wife. And
you don’t know me. You can’t.</l>
<l>I don’t... why would you say that?</l>
<l>She’s great.</l>
<l>I’m gonna try to make a call. I’ll
see you in there.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>I think you should go inside.</l>
<l>I don’t know you.</l>
<l>Sadie.</l>
<l>I don’t want to do that.</l>
<l>I just needed a break.</l>
<l>Tommy, there’s something wrong
here. Something bad is happening.</l>
<l>It doesn’t feel safe here.</l>
<l>What do you want me to do?</l>
<l>Oh. That’s all?</l>
<l>Okay.</l>
<l>Where’s Choi?</l>
<l>Where’s Choi? Where the fuck is
Choi?</l>
<l>I just got a message from him. He
said he was here. That he got here
at seven.</l>
<l>He said he was here.</l>
<l>Where is he?</l>
<l>I got a message from him. He said
he was here. He was right outside
when he called.</l>
<l>Don’t lie to me. He called from
your front door!</l>
<l>Why is everyone is being so fucking
polite? Where is Choi?!</l>
<l>No. This isn’t right. Something
very strange is going on and no one
is saying anything.</l>
<l>Who are you? I don’t get why you’re
here.</l>
<l>Two years. We don’t see you for two
years. And then suddenly you invite
us to this lavish dinner... all
smiles, spewing all of this
jargon...</l>
<l>... with these two in tow. Don’t
tell me this is normal. The
Invitation?</l>
<l>It’s a cult, Miguel! A fucking
cult!</l>
<l>Our son died, and you’re ignoring
it! You are just... you’re trying
to make me ignore it, too. How can
you do this?</l>
<l>Look at the video. It isn’t about
communion or family. It’s about
denial. It’s a fucking brainwash.</l>
<l>It meant something when he died.
Don’t erase... we haven’t even said
his name tonight! You’re trying to
erase him. Ty was real. It was
real. It is real.</l>
<l>Please, Eden... where is Choi?</l>
<l>Don’t patronize me, David.</l>
<l>Tell me why the doors are locked...</l>
<l>Tell me why there are bars on the
windows. Tell me why there’s a big
fucking bottle of phenobarbitol
stashed in your bedroom.</l>
<l>No! Something is going on.
Something dangerous, and we’re all
just ignoring it because David
opened some good wine!</l>
<l>I...</l>
<l>David.</l>
<l>I’m fine...</l>
<l>Eden, I’m so sorry...</l>
<l>It’s very difficult for me to be
here.</l>
<l>You’re right. It’s none of my
business.</l>
<l>I’m very sorry.</l>
<l>Excuse me for one second.</l>
<l>... keep washing... ten seconds at
least...</l>
<l>I can’t.</l>
<l>I’m just... Kira, I’m not okay.</l>
<l>It isn’t good. This is not good.</l>
<l>I’ve had help. It doesn’t work.
Nothing works.</l>
<l>My son is dead. Where do I put
that?</l>
<l>it. It’s like a scream trapped
inside of me.</l>
<l>And there’s no changing the fact
that I wasn’t watching carefully
enough that day.</l>
<l>I can’t live with that. I can’t...</l>
<l>Another kid. I can’t even feel...
Ty loved him. They were just
playing. Just messing around. I
shouldn’t have let them have the
bat. But he’s just a kid. So I
can’t even.. I can’t...</l>
<l>It was just a kid.</l>
<l>I’ve been waiting to die since the
moment it happened.</l>
<l>Look at Eden. That’s what letting
go looks like.</l>
<l>I love you, Kira. But I don’t think
you can help.</l>
<l>I’m sorry.</l>
<l>I’m so sorry.</l>
<l>Can I look at his room?</l>
<l>God. Oh god. Oh god.</l>
<l>Don’t drink it! Don’t fucking touch
it!</l>
<l>Don’t drink it!</l>
<l>We have to get out of here!</l>
<l>Let’s go.</l>
<l>Do not drink that!</l>
<l>Gina. Gina...</l>
<l>Choi! No!</l>
<l>Kira!</l>
<l>Ben! Ben! This way!</l>
<l>Try to find a light, Kira...</l>
<l>Kira.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Kira....</l>
<l>We can’t just wait here. For them
to come. He has a gun...</l>
<l>We have to get ready. We have to do
whatever it takes. They are just
people.</l>
<l>I know you will.</l>
<l>Let me go first.</l>
<l>There’s a door to the garage. Up
there.</l>
<l>Look for keys. Something to open
the window. Something....</l>
<l>Where is it?</l>
<l>We can get through this.</l>
<l>We’re gonna make it.</l>
<l>You have to get the gun.</l>
<l>She shot herself, David!</l>
<l>We have a gun!</l>
<l>Kira.</l>
<l>David! Don’t do it!</l>
<l>Eden...</l>
<l>We’ll meet you on the road, okay?</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>Kira. Stay with me.</l>
