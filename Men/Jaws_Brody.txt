<l>Look at me, I'm not even awake.</l>
<l>Living here is time off.</l>
<l>Larry Vaughn says we'll pull a record
season. Ellen, we're collecting high
enough rentals to cover the mortgage
payments for all three of our beachfront
investments.</l>
<l>Uh...look, Ellie. Let's just ---.</l>
<l>Mornin' Hendricks. What's what?</l>
<l>First goddamn weekend of the summer...
great start!</l>
<l>No...take him back to the beach.
Maybe she washed in.</l>
<l>Christine what?</l>
<l>You picked her up on the ferry.</l>
<l>And nobody else saw her in the water?</l>
<l>Sounds to me like maybe she ran out
on you.</l>
<l>We may know in a minute.</l>
<l>Jesus, Santos.</l>
<l>Polly, I want to know what water
recreation the Island fathers have
on for today.</l>
<l>Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'
signs?</l>
<l>Call me later in the afternoon,
Harry.</l>
<l>Let Polly do the printing.</l>
<l>Oh, brother! Gimme the keys, Lenny.</l>
<l>Are you asking me as the Mayor, or
as a Real Estate broker, or our of
friendly interest, or what, Larry?</l>
<l>So what you're suggesting is we lay out
a smorgasbord for the shark. All you can
eat for the price of a weekend on Amity
Island.</l>
<l>What else could do that?!</l>
<l>What is this?</l>
<l>You print whatever you want.</l>
<l>I... don't go around the water much.</l>
<l>If that's the test case for your
million-to-one shot, I'm glad I lost.</l>
<l>Love a cup of tea. With lemon.</l>
<l>Where is he?</l>
<l>Son! -- Out of the water now!</l>
<l>Tell him I want him out of the ocean.</l>
<l>Michael! Come inside the house!</l>
<l>I told him not to go out until he
memorized the handbook, safety regulations
and ---.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Did you say something?</l>
<l>How's the water?</l>
<l>Drowning.</l>
<l>MICHAEL -- ! EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER!! MICHAEL -- !</l>
<l>Larry and I have agreed to close
all beaches for a limited period
of time to give us a chance to
contact the Port Authority and
United States Coast Guard out on
Montaux.</l>
<l>We never agreed to that.</l>
<l>Listen, Larry, I'm going to talk
to her. This isn't a contest we
want everybody from Boston to
Quebec entering.</l>
<l>Larry, I'm responsible for the public safety around here....</l>
<l>But nobody sport-fishes for shark!</l>
<l>Looks more like the Harvard Lampoon.</l>
<l>Isn't there a limit to how many
men those boats'll carry?</l>
<l>No dynamite! Hand that stuff over
or you'll never leave port!</l>
<l>It belongs to whoever catches it.</l>
<l>You'll move this car to a parking
slot, mister, or it won't be here
when you get back.</l>
<l>It's always nice to meet an educated
man.</l>
<l>I don't have time to help you with
your homework.</l>
<l>One shark did all this?</l>
<l>You'll pardon me i f I don't help
you get your Ph.D. while my town here
degenerates into some high-class
ghost resort.</l>
<l>We've had two other attacks since
the Watkins thing, both fatal.
Could you kill it for us?</l>
<l>Then how do we begin to cooperate?</l>
<l>Let him.</l>
<l>Want to see?</l>
<l>Yours?</l>
<l>Is it the one?</l>
<l>The Institute of Sharks sent him
to lend a hand -- Matt Hooper.</l>
<l>-- the boy's mother.</l>
<l>He's a fish expert from the Oceanographic
Foundation.</l>
<l>Some field you picked.</l>
<l>He would have called his wife.</l>
<l>No point sending up a plane, huh?</l>
<l>I don't do so hot on boats.</l>
<l>Listen ---.</l>
<l>But you could protect the beach -- !
I mean, you have access to ---.</l>
<l>What do I do then? Pray for
lousy weather?</l>
<l>I told you not to wear that crackerjack
ring. It's too big -- you're
gonna catch it on something and
lose a finger.</l>
<l>More in the spirit of the public
interest.</l>
<l>Don't sleep with that on, son.
You'll cut something in the night.</l>
<l>In case you haven't caught the
island gossip, I never take baths
-- just showers.</l>
<l>Yeah. Listen. I'm no crack meteorologist,
but I think we're in store
for some surf.</l>
<l>No. Here, wait.</l>
<l>I could throw your ass in jail for
that.</l>
<l>Once hooked, what then?</l>
<l>Now let's wait a minute. You have
him hooked, right?</l>
<l>And you stick that -- cigarette
case to his neck?</l>
<l>Then you let it loose. You let
it go free.</l>
<l>Your little lab experiment has
seen three innocent people killed
over the past three days.</l>
<l>And your list makes me sick. You
carry it around with you like
you're keeping score.</l>
<l>Oh, Christ. Whose side are you on?
You told me you'd help us get rid
of it.</l>
<l>I don't give a crap about your
worldwide conquest. What about
right here? This town is going
under today! Where's your humanity?
You could kill this thing for us,
flatten its ass and ---.</l>
<l>If you stick that wet spot under
the black light at the Coney
Island Aquarium, they'll let you
in for nothing.</l>
<l>Mr. Hooper figured its size from
this -- it's over a ton. It's
also over ---.</l>
<l>What should we do about this white?</l>
<l>Maybe we can make it up in August.</l>
<l>We have to give this a coupla weeks.</l>
<l>Don't let him out of your sight.
Not for a second. Stay at a discreet
distance -- and dammit,
Lenny, no shark talk! The way
sound carries over water, you're
a dead giveaway.</l>
<l>Local hire...I don't know. I want
to hear from you, Len.</l>
<l>I know it's late, Mr. Quint.</l>
<l>I would have called you ---.</l>
<l>I'm Chief Brody, Mr. Quint --.</l>
<l>Listen ---.</l>
<l>Got Ben Gardner this time.</l>
<l>I need to talk to you, Quint ---.</l>
<l>We can't have this damn thing
sneaking in ---.</l>
<l>Ever caught one?</l>
<l>Now you're asking ten thousand
dollars, but look ---.</l>
<l>How's four hundred a day, Quint?</l>
<l>How much do you want?</l>
<l>I came on my own, Quint.</l>
<l>See, if we could make a deal tonight --.</l>
<l>Quint, you know they'll never ---.</l>
<l>Seventy-five for who?</l>
<l>I have to tell them something
reasonable ---.</l>
<l>Any luck?</l>
<l>How can you be sure?</l>
<l>Are you feeling okay?</l>
<l>Vaughn's going to want a statement.
What about taking precautions?</l>
<l>And you're sure it's ---</l>
<l>Makes sort of a long black
curtain.</l>
<l>But it doesn't always work.</l>
<l>That, and Tang.</l>
<l>No, I'll be sticking to business
today. As you see, we have spotters
up and down the beach, and out there's
the Coast Guard, State Police, County
Police -- everyone's cooperating
on this ---.</l>
<l>It never hurts to play it safe.</l>
<l>Hey Mikey -- !</l>
<l>You're not going to the ocean
with that, are you son?</l>
<l>Do me this favor just once. Use
the ponds.</l>
<l>Just a favor for your old man.</l>
<l>Everybody out! Out of the water,
please -- leave the water, please ---.</l>
<l>No whistles! No whistles!</l>
<l>Anywhere we can see it's dead.</l>
<l>Call me. Soon as you have some news.</l>
<l>I'll go.</l>
<l>I really want to go, Mr. Quint.</l>
<l>I'll get a pro to come along.</l>
<l>You still think it's all the way
out here?</l>
<l>You got it?</l>
<l>He's nearly up ---.</l>
<l>He's hurt.....</l>
<l>I don't understand though...How you
expect to ---.</l>
<l>Where'd it go?</l>
<l>Why don't we go in? Have a crack
tomorrow....?</l>
<l>What -- What the hell --- ?</l>
<l>Are we leaking?</l>
<l>Can't I bail or something?</l>
<l>No -- still there!</l>
<l>Please, Matt, don't get him sore.
He's loony enough.</l>
<l>Put all that stuff away before he
finds out.</l>
<l>Shark! Starboard! It's under
you -- !</l>
<l>We can't do it ourselves....</l>
<l>He chewed through this, he cracked
your boat -- radio in for help ---.</l>
<l>I mean it! Send out an S.O.S.!</l>
<l>I'll do it.</l>
<l>This won't kill it!</l>
<l>I can't stand here doing nothing!</l>
<l>What about us?</l>
<l>Where'd he go?</l>
<l>Have you ever had one do this?</l>
<l>There -- !</l>
<l>He's trying to sink us!</l>
<l>He's chasing us...I don't believe
it.</l>
<l>Maybe we killed it?</l>
<l>Live and learn.</l>
<l>Quint... Quint... is he dead?</l>
