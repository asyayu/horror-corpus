<l>Ow...</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>...Hello?</l>
<l>Father?</l>
<l>Father, what are you...</l>
<l>Jesus!</l>
<l>Oh, that, was bad, that was bad...
I shouldn’t have done that...</l>
<l>Shit.</l>
<l>Those people! Who were... who...</l>
<l>I’m a bicycle courier. I was riding
a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut
across me... and then I wake up in
hospital, today... I wake up and
I’m hallucinating, or...</l>
<l>Jim.</l>
<l>Where are your families?</l>
<l>No... No! I’m going to find them.
They live in Greenwich. I can walk. I’m going to... to go and...</l>
<l>Yes! I’ll go and come back.</l>
<l>Down there. Westlink Street. Second
on the left.</l>
<l>I understand.</l>
<l>I understand.</l>
<l>I’m not grateful.</l>
<l>My old room was at the end of the
landing. You two take it. I’ll
sleep down here.</l>
<l>It’s empty.</l>
<l>Help!</l>
<l>It’s Mr. Bridges...</l>
<l>He lives four doors down...</l>
<l>That’s his daughter...</l>
<l>No... No! I wasn’t!</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>I... I don’t know. I think so.</l>
<l>How did you know?</l>
<l>How did you know he was infected?</l>
<l>The blood was everywhere. On me, on
you, and...</l>
<l>How long had you known him?</l>
<l>Let’s hope we don’t have to get out
of here in a hurry.</l>
<l>No. You?</l>
<l>I do need a break, by the way.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>I’ve got a headache.</l>
<l>Pretty bad.</l>
<l>Because I didn’t think you’d give a
shit.</l>
<l>...Do you have Sprite?</l>
<l>Jesus!</l>
<l>I can’t.</l>
<l>Let us in!</l>
<l>I’m Jim.</l>
<l>This is your place, then.</l>
<l>It’s nice.</l>
<l>There aren’t any others in the
building?</l>
<l>Yes. Fine.</l>
<l>It’s fine.</l>
<l>I’ll take the living room.</l>
<l>Good night, Frank.</l>
<l>Very shredded.</l>
<l>So what do you make of them?</l>
<l>...I think they’re good people.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Right. Because if they slowed you
down...</l>
<l>In a heartbeat.</l>
<l>I wouldn’t.</l>
<l>Selena - you think I don’t get it.
But I do get it. And I know I’d be
dead already if I hadn’t met you.</l>
<l>No, look - I mean thank you.</l>
<l>Good night.</l>
<l>Morning.</l>
<l>They’re all empty...</l>
<l>Right.</l>
<l>It’s a recording?</l>
<l>The North...</l>
<l>Maybe they’ve got a cure.</l>
<l>Get there how?</l>
<l>Then we should go the indirect
route. The one in broad daylight.
That isn’t underground.</l>
<l>I knew this was a shit idea. You
know why? Because it was really
obviously a shit idea. Driving into
a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars
and broken glass is really fucking
obviously a shit idea.</l>
<l>Oh no.</l>
<l>The world’s worst place to get a
flat.</l>
<l>...You heard that?</l>
<l>Holy shit.</l>
<l>Fuck you!</l>
<l>You’re getting out?</l>
<l>Wait!</l>
<l>It’s okay. I think you can eat this
stuff raw.</l>
<l>It isn’t any crap. It’s whisky. It
might be good to have.</l>
<l>Jesus Christ. We’re never going to
be able to get out of London.</l>
<l>Nice cut-through.</l>
<l>...What?</l>
<l>We don’t have any cheeseburgers.</l>
<l>“Stay close.” It’s like going on
holiday with your fucking aunt.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Who’s unbelievably hungry?</l>
<l>Let’s have a picnic.</l>
<l>These are great. They’re like huge
biscuits.</l>
<l>An de phraisins ar phrill moipht.</l>
<l>I said, the raisins are still
moist.</l>
<l>You know what I was thinking?</l>
<l>That’s what you were thinking.</l>
<l>About what?</l>
<l>That’s what I was thinking.</l>
<l>Uh-huh. You stole my thought.</l>
<l>Ah, keep it.</l>
<l>Nor can I. It doesn’t feel safe,
outdoors like this.</l>
<l>I know. I noticed that too.</l>
<l>Selena... Selena!</l>
<l>How did you manage to get to sleep?</l>
<l>Valium. Great. Not only will it get
us to sleep, but if we get attacked
during the night, we won’t even
care.</l>
<l>Two each?</l>
<l>What about...?</l>
<l>Fuck you!</l>
<l>What...</l>
<l>Okay, Dad.</l>
<l>Here you go, Frank. This is how you
catch dew. I’m covered in the
fucking stuff.</l>
<l>Bloody hell...</l>
<l>But, the whole of Manchester. The
whole city...</l>
<l>It can’t be...</l>
<l>Try the horn.</l>
<l>It looks deserted.</l>
<l>They didn’t all leave.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>We were hoping for...</l>
<l>I didn’t know what to imagine,
so... We just feel lucky to have
found you.</l>
<l>You’re keeping him alive?</l>
<l>And has he?</l>
<l>...So how is she?</l>
<l>Hey, don’t...do that. Look,
Hannah... Hannah’s what Frank said
she was. Tough. Strong. And just
like me, just like you, she will
cope...</l>
<l>Cut it out!</l>
<l>Look. We’re grateful. Very grateful
for your protection, and just to
have found other people. But if
we’re going to stay here with you,
you’re going to have to stop your
men from -.</l>
<l>I haven’t killed anyone.</l>
<l>A boy. I killed a boy.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Get up. Get up!</l>
<l>We’ve got to get out of here!</l>
<l>We’re leaving. Now! NOW!</l>
<l>... Quarantine?</l>
<l>Hannah! Selena!</l>
<l>That was longer than a heartbeat.</l>
<l>Listen to me. I’ve got to tell you -
I’ve got to tell you. The world
isn’t fucked. It’s going to be
okay. We’ve got a chance, if we can
get to...</l>
<l>Ow!</l>
<l>I was kissing her!</l>
<l>Are you stoned?</l>
<l>Just fucking do it!</l>
<l>Jesus. Not the curtains too.</l>
<l>You looked all right in this, you
know.</l>
<l>Do you think he saw us this time?</l>
