<l>Am I starting to look Norwegian
to you, Bwana?</l>
<l>How my brothers and sisters doing
today? Doin' fine.</l>
<l>What say to some nice Al Green for my babies, huh?</l>
<l>What you? ... You get hell on out of here.</l>
<l>... Comin' in here ... goin' to urinate on my babies.</l>
<l>Mac wants the what??</l>
<l>What's happening?</l>
<l>Where are you?</l>
<l>The dogs?</l>
<l>'Tweren't no dog, Bwana.</l>
<l>Okay now, Mac, run this by me again.
Thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes, right? ..And the ....</l>
<l>MacReady!</l>
<l>Well, go on.</l>
<l>I just can't believe this voodoo
bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?</l>
<l>Cool it, Palmer!!</l>
<l>So, MacReady, come on now. These
Norwegian dudes come by ... find him and dig him up ...</l>
<l>Now how's this motherfucker wake
up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?</l>
<l>You buy any of this, Blair?</l>
<l>You're saying...that big muther in the ice, became that dog.</l>
<l>He got both choppers and the tractor
... I don't know how bad yet.</l>
<l>I can get maybe another five or
six feet out of it.</l>
<l>Hhat is it?</l>
<l>Where's the other half?</l>
<l>They could be hours ahead of us,
Mac.</l>
<l>Where's the other one?</l>
<l>What we going to do?!</l>
<l>But....</l>
<l>Bullshit! You left it open so
they could get out!</l>
<l>Don't you be telling me ...</l>
<l>Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.</l>
<l>Whose uncontaminated blood we going to use?</l>
<l>That key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?</l>
<l>So what?! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! Bullshit!</l>
<l>I'll take it...</l>
<l>What do we do about those three?</l>
<l>You can eighty-six that thought
right now, man.</l>
<l>No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.</l>
<l>Ain't it there?</l>
<l>Be quick.</l>
<l>Oh, no.</l>
<l>No. The generator. You got the
auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.</l>
<l>Where's the damn flashlight?</l>
<l>You fellas okay over there?</l>
<l>Cut that out, Copper.</l>
<l>Nauls? What's taking you?!</l>
<l>That's impossible, man! Okay,
Clark, out of the john where I car: see you!</l>
<l>Clark, you come on out here!!</l>
<l>Where's ... Where's Garry?</l>
<l>Where are you, Garry? Don't you
move an inch, Copper.</l>
<l>Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!</l>
<l>Clark, you want me to come in after
you?!</l>
<l>MacReady!</l>
<l>Garry's missing!</l>
<l>Gee, thanks!</l>
<l>Where'd you go?</l>
<l>I said where? Where'd you go?!</l>
<l>You lying bastard ...</l>
<l>You sit back qown....</l>
<l>Well, who says I want you going
with me?!</l>
<l>Don't walk behind me.</l>
<l>Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.</l>
<l>My babies.</l>
<l>Now who'd go and do....</l>
<l>Let go me...</l>
<l>What's it going to do, being a
plant?</l>
<l>Now hold on, you dumb...</l>
<l>You stupid, sonofa ...</l>
<l>No one's that strong, boy!</l>
<l>W asn't enough time. Generator was out, what? .. Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.</l>
<l>He was working on a test. Fuchs must have been onto something. These bastards got scared and got rid of him.</l>
<l>...Hey... Where's...</l>
<l>Nauls!! MacReady!!</l>
<l>How long they been out now?</l>
<l>We better start closing off the
outside hatchways.</l>
<l>Cut him loose?</l>
<l>If it did get to him.</l>
<l>Hell no.</l>
<l>... Nothing human could have made
it back here in this weather without a guideline ...</l>
<l>Why you so damn anxious to let him in here ...</l>
<l>No. Just let him freeze out there.</l>
<l>Then we're wrong.</l>
<l>Damnit, he's got the keys.</l>
<l>You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!</l>
<l>We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.</l>
<l>You been made, MacReady.</l>
<l>Move in slow now.</l>
<l>We ain't buying that.</l>
<l>You're going to have to sleep sometime.</l>
<l>What for?</l>
<l>You ain't tying me up.</l>
<l>Then kill me.</l>
<l>I guess you do.</l>
<l>We should have jumped his ass.</l>
<l>Load of bullshit.</l>
<l>So Clark was human, huh?</l>
<l>So that makes you a murderer.</l>
<l>Let's do it, Bwana.</l>
<l>Muthafu ....</l>
<l>Get me... get me the hell away from
... cut me loose, damn it!</l>
<l>Spaceship of some kind.</l>
<l>Did you kill it?</l>
<l>What do you mean 'you think so?'</l>
<l>It'll turn black again soon enough.
Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing ...</l>
<l>... Think my toes are already gone.</l>
<l>So you're the only one who made it.</l>
<l>The fire's got the temperature way
up all over camp... won't last long though.</l>
<l>Maybe we should try and fix the
radio ... try and get some help.</l>
<l>Then we'll never make it.</l>
<l>If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.</l>
<l>I guess I'll be learning.</l>
