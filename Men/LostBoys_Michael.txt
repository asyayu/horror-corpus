<l>Keep going.</l>
<l>Keep going.</l>
<l>Keep going!</l>
<l>I need to stretch my legs. I'll
follow you.</l>
<l>For what.</l>
<l>That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.</l>
<l>He looks dead.</l>
<l>He's not breathing, Mom.</l>
<l>This is kind of a cool place.</l>
<l>Will you give Mom a break?</l>
<l>Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.</l>
<l>This room is mine.</l>
<l>Okay. I'll flip you for it.</l>
<l>Owwww! You little shit!</l>
<l>You're beautiful.</l>
<l>Nowhere.</l>
<l>Don't you have something better
to do than follow me around all
night?</l>
<l>Well, I...</l>
<l>Well... yeah. Sure.</l>
<l>I just wanted to... I, uh...</l>
<l>It's early. Why do we have to
go home?</l>
<l>I'll hitch.</l>
<l>Mom, just give me five more minutes.
Just five minutes, okay?</l>
<l>Come on, Sam, you know before
there were malls there was 'like
the ocean.'</l>
<l>See you later.</l>
<l>I'll pass.</l>
<l>Hi...</l>
<l>What's your name?</l>
<l>Oh. Your folks, too, huh?</l>
<l>Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I
came this close to being called
Moon Child, or Moon Beam or
something.</l>
<l>But Star's great. I like Star.</l>
<l>I'm Michael.</l>
<l>Sort of. We used to come here
summers when I was kid. Now
we're here on a permanent basis.</l>
<l>Are you hungry? Wanna get
something to eat?</l>
<l>We still going?</l>
<l>That's right.</l>
<l>Star?...</l>
<l>I can't beat a Triumph.</l>
<l>We were gonna grab some food.</l>
<l>Where are you guys from?</l>
<l>I mean, where do you live?</l>
<l>You live here? Your folks let
you?</l>
<l>What?...</l>
<l>Worms!</l>
<l>Don't! Stop!</l>
<l>Good joke, blood.</l>
<l>Go away.</l>
<l>Entertain yourself.</l>
<l>I can't remember much after the
Chinese food that looked like
maggots.</l>
<l>What would that make Mom?</l>
<l>Beat it, Nanook.</l>
<l>No. Why?</l>
<l>I told you it was pretty weird
Chinese food.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>Ouch.</l>
<l>I wouldn't have given my Mom
such a hard time about moving
here if I'd known I was going to
meet you.</l>
<l>Now you and David...</l>
<l>Let's go see them.</l>
<l>I'm my own man.</l>
<l>What's going' on?</l>
<l>Mom's home?...</l>
<l>Oh, shit...</l>
<l>Hi, Mom...</l>
<l>No. I'm up.</l>
<l>I watch him all day. The only time
I have more myself is at night. Let
Grandpa watch him.</l>
<l>Okay.</l>
<l>Big date, Grandpa?</l>
<l>Oh, yeah. What'd you stuff for
her? Mr. Johnson?</l>
<l>Don't bother.</l>
<l>Piss off.</l>
<l>What's that?...</l>
<l>Don't turn on the light.</l>
<l>Nanook...</l>
<l>Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He
bit me! This is my blood!</l>
<l>He was protecting you!</l>
<l>What??</l>
<l>Help me! Sam -- help me! I'm
your brother!</l>
<l>We've got to stick together, Sam.
You've got to help me.</l>
<l>No! We can't tell Mom!</l>
<l>Please, Sam. Don't tell her.</l>
<l>Just for a few days, Sam. Give me
a chance to work this out by myself.</l>
<l>Star?</l>
<l>Star. I have to talk to you.</l>
<l>I have to talk to you. Please
wake up.</l>
<l>When?</l>
<l>Sure.</l>
<l>We are...</l>
<l>I'm tired now.</l>
<l>Mom... please.</l>
<l>Can't. Got plans of my own.</l>
<l>Gotta go, Mom.</l>
<l>Yeah. Max... right?</l>
<l>Come in, come in. I'm inviting
you.</l>
<l>See ya.</l>
<l>Where is she?!</l>
<l>Where's Star, David?!</l>
<l>What is this, David?</l>
<l>I know everything.</l>
<l>I don't know.</l>
<l>Okay.</l>
<l>Do you know where David took me
tonight, Star? Do you?!</l>
<l>That night in the cave -- that
wasn't wine they gave me to
drink... it was blood! David's
blood.</l>
<l>I'm one of them, Star! I'm just
like them!</l>
<l>Why not?</l>
<l>Then it's not too late for us...</l>
<l>I know, I've felt it...</l>
<l>You're not going anywhere...</l>
<l>Star.</l>
<l>Who are you calling?</l>
<l>Of course not!</l>
<l>David.</l>
<l>I'll take you there.</l>
<l>I said, I'll take you there.
Nobody's going near Star without
me.</l>
<l>Down there.</l>
<l>Sam... if something happens to me.
If I don't have the strength to go
on, promise me you won't let them
hurt Star.</l>
<l>Star. You're coming with me.</l>
<l>You've got to put this on.</l>
<l>Huh?</l>
<l>Huh?...</l>
<l>Take him outside, Sam!</l>
<l>No, Grandpa...</l>
<l>They'll be coming for all of us.</l>
<l>Sam, don't --.</l>
<l>Duck, Sam.</l>
<l>David!</l>
<l>Catch!</l>
<l>I... I don't feel any differently.</l>
<l>Do you?</l>
<l>I didn't invite you in this time!</l>
<l>Get out, Mom! Run!</l>
<l>It's gone. I feel it!</l>
<l>Everyone accounted for?</l>
