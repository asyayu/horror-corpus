<l>This is it.</l>
<l>So... what do you think?</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Let her go. It's cool.</l>
<l>Ellie, you heard your m--.</l>
<l>Ellie! Are you all right?</l>
<l>Anyone who can scream that loud
isn't ready for intensive care just
yet -- looks like she just skinned
her knee.</l>
<l>Would you get the first aid kit?</l>
<l>Jesus, the road!</l>
<l>Yes -- thanks. I'm Louis Creed.</l>
<l>No. I Guess not.</l>
<l>Hey -- they actually found the
place.</l>
<l>Well, maybe I --.</l>
<l>Great.</l>
<l>Well, I've got a million questions
about the are, and --.</l>
<l>I really do have a million
questions.</l>
<l>It's me.</l>
<l>Not at all.</l>
<l>Jesus!</l>
<l>Where does it lead?</l>
<l>Pet cemetery?</l>
<l>My daughter's got a cat. Winston
Churchill. We call him Church for
short.</l>
<l>I'll take it under advisement.</l>
<l>And yours.</l>
<l>Church! God, you scared the life
out of me!</l>
<l>Alright, Missy. Thanks.</l>
<l>My God!</l>
<l>Not yet. How much
farther?</l>
<l>I think it's rather extraordinary.</l>
<l>Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?</l>
<l>Fine. Come and see.</l>
<l>For a little while.</l>
<l>I think it is so, Ellie.</l>
<l>Hi, babe.</l>
<l>Honey, Church will be fine.</l>
<l>Lovey... Church might still be
alive when you're in high school...
and that's a very long time.</l>
<l>If it was up to me I'd let Church
live to be a hundred... but I don't
make up the rules.</l>
<l>She was a little over-exited,
that's all. Poor kid.</l>
<l>All at once he's my friend. Rachel!</l>
<l>Rachel, Church is going to fie.</l>
<l>Honey, we can't be sure of th--.</l>
<l>There's nothing wrong with a child
finding out something about death,
Rachel. In fact, I'd call it a
necessary thing. Ellie's reaction --
her crying -- that seemed perfectly
natural to me. It--.</l>
<l>Ellie has known where babies come
from since last year.</l>
<l>It does, though. When I was talking
to her about Church I got thinking
about my mother and how she spun me
that old cabbage leaf story when I
asked her where women got babies.
I've never forgotten that lie.
Children never forget the lies
their parents tell them.</l>
<l>I have to go. Big day tomorrow.</l>
<l>Maybe I'll get you drunk first.</l>
<l>Good God! Where'd you hear that?</l>
<l>The road's a lot more dangerous
than any operation. Church will be
just the same. Well -- almost the
same -- and we won't have to worry
about him being turned into catburger by one of those damn
Orinco trucks. Church will be
alright, honey.</l>
<l>Well, honey... you know that...</l>
<l>Church will be fine. I promise.</l>
<l>Oh, you're welcome. Only if
something should go wrong while
he's under the gas -- it's a one-in
a-thousand shot, but it happens --
you explain it to her.</l>
<l>Gotta go.</l>
<l>-- nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy</l>
<l>How's that belly-ache of yours?</l>
<l>You ought to see a doctor about it.</l>
<l>Not so much as a sprain.</l>
<l>Get her out. Get them all out.</l>
<l>Steve, get the ambulance over here
right now. He's gotta go to EMMC.</l>
<l>-- a new muffler, oh shit --.</l>
<l>Help me hold him.</l>
<l>It wouldn't matter if we had the
SST.</l>
<l>He's going, Steve, go call the
motor pool. Marcy, roll out the
crash wagon.</l>
<l>I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules!</l>
<l>There wasn't even supposed to be a
sprain today, my friend. That's
what I told Rachel.</l>
<l>W-What did you say...?</l>
<l>How did you know my name?</l>
<l>Dammit, how did you know my name?</l>
<l>Get a sheet.</l>
<l>He said my name. I heard it. He
said my name.</l>
<l>Oh. Thanks God.</l>
<l>I don't like this dream.</l>
<l>I want to wake up. I want to wake
up, that's all. I --.</l>
<l>Please, I want to wake up. Leave me
alone. It's not my fault you dies;
you were as good as dead when they
brought you in --.</l>
<l>Gettin' ready.</l>
<l>Good d--.</l>
<l>Just comin'.</l>
<l>That's why you're going with the
kids and without me. As far as your
dad's concerned, I'm never going to
be part of the family.</l>
<l>I'll be around plenty when you get
back.</l>
<l>Say hello to your folks.</l>
<l>Hello?</l>
<l>Jud? What trouble?</l>
<l>Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.</l>
<l>Yeah. It's Church.</l>
<l>Ellie will, though. She'll suffer
plenty.</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>Put him in the garage, I guess.
Bury him in the morning.</l>
<l>Guess that's what it's there for,
huh?</l>
<l>I... I'll have to mull that one
over a while. Maybe... maybe when
they call I'll just tell Ellie I
haven't seen the damn cat around.
You know, I don't want to spoil her
holiday. And Rachel's.</l>
<l>Jud, this is crazy. It's dark. It's
late. And cold.</l>
<l>It can wait until tomorrow when we
can see.</l>
<l>Yes, but --.</l>
<l>Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
Creed dreamland.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>Do we plant him on the outer circle
or start a new one?</l>
<l>What do you mean?</l>
<l>We can't climb over that. We'll
break our necks.</l>
<l>Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.</l>
<l>God, this is amazing!</l>
<l>-- and don't look down. Right --.</l>
<l>Holy...</l>
<l>I'm alright! I'm f--.</l>
<l>Sure. I guess I just lost my happy
thoughts for a second there.</l>
<l>It does bite.</l>
<l>Where are we going, Jud?</l>
<l>Jud? What's --.</l>
<l>What in Christ's name...?</l>
<l>Is there quicksand?</l>
<l>Are there ghosts?</l>
<l>You're telling me.</l>
<l>It's funny, alright.</l>
<l>You keep saying that.</l>
<l>What is this place?</l>
<l>Whose burial ground?</l>
<l>Why? For God's sake, why?</l>
<l>Jud, why am I doing all this?</l>
<l>Pax vobiscum. Church old buddy. You
were a hell of a good cat. I doubt
if you were worth all this
aggravation, but you were a hell of
a good cat.</l>
<l>Oh, shit! Rachel!</l>
<l>Jud... what did we do tonight?</l>
<l>Is that all we did?</l>
<l>Hi, Dory... it's Louis --.</l>
<l>That's be real fine.</l>
<l>Hi, babe. How are things out there
in Chicagoland?</l>
<l>Well... I guess he's just fine,
Ellie. I haven't seen him this
evening, but --.</l>
<l>Yuck! Kiss your own cat!</l>
<l>Church!</l>
<l>Food, Church... food!</l>
<l>Come on, Church! Chow down!</l>
<l>Christ. I don't believe this.</l>
<l>You stink, Church.</l>
<l>In a second.</l>
<l>Chewed his way out. Jesus
Baldheaded Christ, he ch--.</l>
<l>Ow!</l>
<l>What did we do?</l>
<l>I tried to tell myself I buried him
alive. I'm not a vet... it was
dark...</l>
<l>I feel like I'm going crazy...</l>
<l>Your mother knew all about it. All
about... that place.</l>
<l>That's why you took me up there?</l>
<l>Has... has anyone ever buried a
person up there?</l>
<l>How the hell did you get in?</l>
<l>Hi, sugar!</l>
<l>Yes... I guess so. He was sleeping
on the front porch when I left.</l>
<l>That was a silly dream, wasn't it?</l>
<l>Yes.</l>
<l>I know.</l>
<l>I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
the money, Ellen.</l>
<l>Yes -- I hate it, too.</l>
<l>Yes. To honor the dead.</l>
<l>Well... a touch of the flu...</l>
<l>That's enough, Ellen.</l>
<l>Hop in.</l>
<l>My father used to have a saying,
Jud -- "God sees the truth, but
waits."</l>
<l>It's Ellie's cat.</l>
<l>What's up, sugar?</l>
<l>Well, I think Michael McDowell is
so full of shit he probably squeaks
when he walks... but don't you dare
say that.</l>
<l>I don't know, honey. Different
people believe all sorts of
different things. Some believe in
heaven or hell. Some think we're
born again as little children. Some
think we just wink out... like a
candle flame when the wind blows
hard.</l>
<l>No. i think we go on. I'm not sure
what happens after we die, but I
think we go on, yeah -- I have
faith in that.</l>
<l>Oh, faith's a little more than just
believing.</l>
<l>I thought maybe you did. I know you
don't approve of the subject.</l>
<l>Scared of what? Dying?</l>
<l>I know she died... spinal
meningitis.</l>
<l>Rachel -- babe -- don't --.</l>
<l>Was it that horrible?</l>
<l>Rachel, that's enough.</l>
<l>Shh -- that's forgotten.</l>
<l>If you were, I salute you for it.</l>
<l>Yes, I salute you for it. And if I
needed another reason to... to
really dislike your mother and
father, I've got it now. You never
should have been left alone with
her, Rachel. Never. Where was the
nurse? There should have been an R.N. They went out, they actually
went out and left an eight-year-old
kid in charge of her dying sister,
who was probably clinically insane
by then? Where was the R-fucking-N?</l>
<l>To get you a valium.</l>
<l>Tonight you do.</l>
<l>If you told me this before, it
would have explained a hell of a
lot.</l>
<l>Just a little phobic. Yeah, right.</l>
<l>No apology needed. But what the
hell, I accept it anyway, it it'll
make you, feel better.</l>
<l>Hey, Gage!</l>
<l>String! You're flyin' it, Gage --
you got the hammer, ma man!</l>
<l>Bet your boots. Look --</l>
<l>See?</l>
<l>Bet your ass, little hero.</l>
<l>What can you d--.</l>
<l>NO!!</l>
<l>No... squatting out there at the
Holiday Inn like a couple of
vultures. He wants Rachel to go
back with them after the funeral.
Her and Ellie.</l>
<l>Ellie --.</l>
<l>Good night, Ellie.</l>
<l>Yes -- I suppose, you can. Good
night, Ellie.</l>
<l>Fuck off, hairball!</l>
<l>Jud, I buried my son today and I'm
very tired. I wonder if we could
just --.</l>
<l>I'm thinkin' about going to bed.</l>
<l>What...? Jud, don't talk crazy.</l>
<l>I'll bite -- what's the bottom of
the truth, Jud?</l>
<l>Tell to my wife and little girl.</l>
<l>What happened?</l>
<l>You're saying the place knew Gage
was going to die.</l>
<l>This can be the start of patching
things up with your folks. If
something good doesn't come of
Gage's death, I think I'll --.</l>
<l>Better get goin', hon.</l>
<l>Come on, you guys -- before you
miss the boat.</l>
<l>We all lost our minds, Irwin.</l>
<l>Be good to your mother, darlin'.</l>
<l>I'll be there in three days -- four
at the most. I've gotta get the
electricity shut off and square
things with your school so the
truant officer ain't after you, and --.</l>
<l>Of what?</l>
<l>Everything's going to be alright,
Ellie.</l>
<l>I swear.</l>
<l>I think we got it all.</l>
<l>It could be.</l>
<l>It's wrong.</l>
<l>What happened to you is wrong.</l>
<l>I'll tell you where the ground is
sour -- the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something
else, Vic-baby; Wrong is wrong.</l>
<l>He was my son! He wasn't even two
and he was run down in the fucking
road and he was almost in pieces.
And if don't think I'm going to
try...</l>
<l>If it doesn't work -- if he comes
back like Jud said Timmy Baterman
was -- I'll put him back to sleep.
And they don't even need to know.
Rachel and Ellie never need to
know, I've got to try.</l>
<l>Gonna bust you out, son.</l>
<l>Oh, Gage -- oh, honey.</l>
<l>It's going to be alright... I swear
it's going to be alright.</l>
<l>Please, God -- let this work.</l>
<l>Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna
look down.</l>
<l>See? Just imagination.</l>
<l>It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.</l>
<l>Come back to me, Gage. Come back to
us.</l>
<l>Jesus!</l>
<l>Gage --?</l>
<l>Oh my God.</l>
<l>Gage!</l>
<l>Hello!</l>
<l>Yes -- I'm here.</l>
<l>Yes, she's fine.</l>
<l>She... Rachel's asleep.</l>
<l>I'll call you right back.</l>
<l>Irwin, you'll just have to --.</l>
<l>Gage?</l>
<l>What did vou do? What did yo-</l>
<l>What you buy is what you own, and
sooner or later what you own comes
home to you. Wasn't that what you
said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much
it?</l>
<l>Hi, Church. Want some grub?</l>
<l>Don't mind me. Eat it while vou
can. Eat all you want.</l>
<l>Eat all you can... all you want...
that's right... todav's
Thanksgiving for cats, but only if
they came back from the dead...</l>
<l>No you don't.</l>
<l>Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be
dead.</l>
<l>Rachel?</l>
<l>Jud?</l>
<l>Gage?</l>
<l>Gage?</l>
<l>Alright, Gage... let's.</l>
<l>I'm sorry, Jud. I'm sorry. I'm --</l>
<l>I'm going to set things back in
order. I... I know just what to do.</l>
<l>Gage?</l>
<l>I waited too long with Gage. But
Rachel� it will work this time.
Because she just died... she just
died a little while ago.</l>
<l>It will be alright, Rachel. I
promise. You'll see, Rachel --</l>
<l>-- a man's heart is stonier.</l>
<l>A man grows what he can... and
tends it. Because what you buy is
what you own...</l>
<l>And what you own always comes home
to you.</l>
