<l>Sharks are equipped with two long
cords of nerve tissue that function
as a sort of radar for homing in on
underwater vibrations.</l>
<l>Understand you're having a little
shark trouble.</l>
<l>I know you have a visitor off your
southern shores. I think it could
be my shark.</l>
<l>Sir, I'm not with these others ---.</l>
<l>I'm interning at the American
Museum of Natural History, but the
Oceanographic Research Institute in
South Africa is co-sponsoring my
thesis paper arm in arm with the
Natural Institute of Health and the
Marine Fishery Service.</l>
<l>I'm trying to prove that the shark
that killed Christine Watkins last
Friday was the same rogue that
savaged these. </l>
<l>The trail of a rogue shark leads
all over the world. This is only
a theory. It has never been authenticated,
but there is a wonderful
chance that the shark that killed
the Watkins girl and the man-eater
I tagged off the Great Barrier Reef
are the one and the same. Off and on
I've tracked it to New Zealand,
Santiago Bay, Cape Town South Africa
...uh...the Gulf of Guinea, then
West Palm Beach, Florida last
December -- and finally predicted
it would follow the warming Gulf
Stream into the Northern Seasonal
Zones, and release an attack pattern
along the Jersey Coast. I was off
by just three hundred miles. It
hit you instead.</l>
<l>All I'm asking is for a little future
cooperation. I could predict future
outbursts of attack activity in the
area. Use me...Let me use you. I
scored 93 on my Orals, for crying
out loud!</l>
<l>No sir, I couldn't.</l>
<l>By letting me see Christine Watkins.</l>
<l>I'll look at her now if you don't
mind.</l>
<l>I've heard the boat-propeller story
several times. And the nocturnal
hatchet-murder story, the dashedupon-
the-razor-coral story --.</l>
<l>The little boy was never found?</l>
<l>They're very successful creatures,
sharks. Eighty million year's
antiquity for the species of the
Great White. The family goes as far
back as three-hundred million. Plenty
of time to get good at what they do.</l>
<l>No, this one's a blue.</l>
<l>It's sure big enough -- ten point
six feet.</l>
<l>I'm not so sure. Blue sharks pretty
much operate on the warm-water law,
and limit their attacks to seventy
degrees and up.</l>
<l>Ocean's fifty-five.</l>
<l>The Great White's body temperature
in the lateral musculature is almost
eighteen degrees above whatever the
temperature of the water. I don't
know if this is our bite culprit.</l>
<l>Only one way to know for sure...</l>
<l>...and since it's not my shark, I'm
not slitting open the belly to see
what portions of the boy is still
inside. Am I...?</l>
<l>This could be it. He's big
enough all right, but I still
can't be sure until ---.</l>
<l>I won't know until I perform a
full autopsy.</l>
<l>Well, there's dolphins -- but they
talk too much.</l>
<l>There're good things to be said
about meshing. It's worked in
Australia for years. Repellent's
a myth. Now there's a cable available
charged with 7,000 amps that
could be strung along the entire
bathing area.</l>
<l>Matt. And I don't drink alcohol,
but thank you.</l>
<l>We think the Great Whites possess
an electrical sense ---.</l>
<l>This is a very good rendering,
Mike. Looks like a thresher.
Where'd you learn to draw him?</l>
<l>Get bitten by the subject...or
just morbid curiosity?</l>
<l>I picked this up in Macao. There's
supposed to be a superstition about
these things -- that if you keep it
with you, you'll be safe from shark
bite.</l>
<l>He was a witness?</l>
<l>In case you haven't caught the
island gossip, I never take baths
-- just showers.</l>
<l>Aquaphobia or what? Mind if I
smoke?</l>
<l>I'm going to try and snag the old
boy with 3/32 of an inch stainless
steel aircraft cable.</l>
<l>Brought my own cage, thanks. If
this really is my shark, he's got
a Peterson disc tag on his anal
fin. It can't be seen from a boat.</l>
<l>Biotelemetry. It's a radio collar.
I bell the cat and then follow him
anywhere. I'm trying to make a
deal with a satellite tracking
station at Houston, Texas.</l>
<l>Well, I'll never take him without
a fight, but --.</l>
<l>That's the game plan.</l>
<l>I know what you're saying, Martin.</l>
<l>Nature has no conscience, Mr. Brody.</l>
<l>What I said was, I'd help predict
future attacks in your area. If
this device works, the early warning
to other shorefront resorts --
not just here, but anywhere it
ranges in the world ---.</l>
<l>I'm staying at the Abilard Arms.</l>
<l>I really liked dinner.</l>
<l>Very deep -- looks like a school.</l>
<l>Mackerel. Really clumped together.</l>
<l>Staying right with us.</l>
<l>Tends to. Gets very still down
there.</l>
<l>I'd better see the damage first.</l>
<l>Did he have a dinghy on board?</l>
<l>Be up in a minute.</l>
<l>A White -- it's a Great White, I
knew it...! Looks like he died
of fright in there.</l>
<l>One this big could do anything!</l>
<l>Meet Carcharodon charcharias.</l>
<l>The shark that just bit you on
the hand.</l>
<l>And this...is you.</l>
<l>Seventeen feet from anterior to
posterior.</l>
<l>The famous Swedish naturalist Linnaeus believed that the 'great
fish' that swallowed Jonah was not
a whale, but a great white shark.</l>
<l>The longer there's nothing to
munch on here, the better your
chances he'll go. That means, of
course, keeping your beaches
closed, your fishermen in port.
The other alternative is noncorrosive,
100-gauge steel mesh --
say, 30,000 feet of it around your
bathing area. Concrete blocks and
installation would run you...oh,
four, five hundred thousand. That
is, unless you could seek a deputation
from the federal government --.</l>
<l>Beats getting swallowed, doesn't it?</l>
<l>Might be for you, Mr. Brody. I
think it's all over.</l>
<l>The sea is full of fish again for
one thing. You won't find sea life
in the territory of a Great White.
All the fish we saw in the ocean
today. You'd think they were celebrating.
I played low-frequency
music underwater -- that usually
works faster than blood.</l>
<l>There are signals in the water. I
can always read them. And the currents are shifting.</l>
<l>I'd take them, sure. Lookout posts.
An alarm system. If you can afford
picket boats equipped with sonar
repellent line across the bathing
area. Jesus...we must have gone six
times around this crummy island.</l>
<l>You'll never be immune to attack.
It knows where you live now. Goodnight.</l>
<l>I feel the same about you.</l>
<l>He's in shock. Get blankets!</l>
<l>I can read signals in the water --
when they're around -- when they
leave. I saw the signals. It
moved on. They reported an attack
up the coast, toward Ipswitch, Maine
today. Oh, Jesus, Martin, I'm sorry..</l>
<l>Powerhead, C.O.2 darts...hypo...
regulator...tanks...depth gauge....</l>
<l>Maybe I'm in the wrong area.</l>
<l>Thanks. I'll see you.</l>
<l>Anti-shark cage.</l>
<l>If necessary.</l>
<l>That's right.</l>
<l>Let's go.</l>
<l>Careful! Compressed air -- you
crack that and it explodes like a
bomb!</l>
<l>And they have brains the size of
a radish.</l>
<l>Can't bring him up so quick ---.</l>
<l>I'm okay....</l>
<l>Why over there?</l>
<l>I can do more than that. Look,
Quint, I brought along a ---.</l>
<l>Closer to thirty feet....</l>
<l>What's the formula...?</l>
<l>Girth, say 150 inches. Squared
and...divide by 800 -- that's six
one, five...6150 by 2000 --.</l>
<l>Just over three tons.</l>
<l>Your harpoons are attached to
these. right?</l>
<l>They pop up and drag on him, drag
on him till he's through -- isn't
that the idea?</l>
<l>What if we have to follow him?</l>
<l>Put that away!</l>
<l>You've got the monopoly, huh? Here!</l>
<l>Look at this one.</l>
<l>Bull-shark scraped me. I was down
getting samples, and he ---.</l>
<l>Eight-foot moray eel -- right
through the suit, buddy.....</l>
<l>Minor League. Where's it from?</l>
<l>A what? You got a what?</l>
<l>Let's move in on him.</l>
<l>You kill him?</l>
<l>How'd you get that one?</l>
<l>The scar on your arm.</l>
<l>Changed your mind about somebody?</l>
<l>You were on her? June '45?</l>
<l>Jesus, Quint! You can't blame ---.</l>
<l>A whale's out there.</l>
<l>I told you I have things to kill it
with...take over up there, I can --
Quint!</l>
<l>He had a turn, now I'll have a turn.</l>
<l>Maybe you should have a turn, too.</l>
<l>Strychnine nitrate, 20 CC's.</l>
<l>All you need to do is lower me in ---.</l>
<l>You know he'll go for the cage ---.</l>
<l>I can finish him in sixty seconds.</l>
<l>Can't you stop this Moby Dick crap?!</l>
<l>Coming right to us!</l>
<l>We can't rev it up this high ---.</l>
<l>Don't shoot him any more! He's
crazy on his own blood already!.</l>
<l>I can't see him!</l>
<l>Your pumps are out too. Drop me
down to twenty feet or so, okay?</l>
<l>Try and keep him off me till I'm
down.</l>
<l>Lower away, Chief.</l>
<l>Don't talk. We've got a long way.</l>
