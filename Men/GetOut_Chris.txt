<l>Are you kidding me? When you’re
          not here that dog gets the best
          fuckin’ pets of his life.</l>
<l>‘Cause he know he’s got you
          wrapped around his little paw.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Check... Check....</l>
<l>I’m not gonna have one the whole
weekend.</l>
<l>I’m nervous.</l>
<l>Yeah? How do you know?</l>
<l>Good answer.</l>
<l>Do they know I’m black?</l>
<l>Seems like you might give them a
heads up.</l>
<l>You said, I’m the first black guy
          you’d ever dated.</l>
<l>So this is uncharted territory for
          them.</l>
<l>Bye.</l>
<l>How do they even let you in a
hospital?</l>
<l>Yeah. You?</l>
<l>How long has it been?</l>
<l>Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I’m a
          grown man. If a man says he wants
          a cigarette, a man should be able
          too- -</l>
<l>Okay, so that’s like a dollar. You
          basically just throwin’ dollars
          out the window.</l>
<l>I didn’t buy them. Rod... Shit.</l>
<l>I almost forgot Rod.</l>
<l>Hey. You at work?</l>
<l>Look, man, real quick. You good to
          watch Sid this weekend right?</l>
<l>You’re right. My bad.</l>
<l>She’s good--.</l>
<l>Okay, get your own girl.</l>
<l>No! What the fuck is wrong with
you?</l>
<l>You need help.</l>
<l>I’ll see what I can do. Oh, and
          I’ll kick you some cash for
          watching Sid.</l>
<l>Thanks, man.</l>
<l>Last one!</l>
<l>You okay?</l>
<l>Yeah. That scared the shit out of
me.</l>
<l>Stay here.</l>
<l>I don’t know... See if it’s okay?</l>
<l>Maybe it’s gone--.</l>
<l>Right. That makes sense.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Oh... yeah.</l>
<l>I mean, I don’t have a driver’s
          license, I have a state I.D.</l>
<l>Baby. It’s okay--.</l>
<l>That was some ride or die shit,
          baby. I like that.</l>
<l>Hey! What’s up?</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Good to finally meet you...</l>
<l>Sure.</l>
<l>Alright.</l>
<l>I’ve heard so much about you guys.</l>
<l>I’m fine with the embarrassing by
          the way; go ahead.</l>
<l>Wow.</l>
<l>I grew up in a one bedroom, so for
me, this is ridiculous.</l>
<l>It came out of nowhere.</l>
<l>Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.</l>
<l>I cannot believe they kept it the
          same.</l>
<l>They’re great.</l>
<l>No, they’re totally sweet.</l>
<l>What?! Is this you?</l>
<l>I didn’t know you acted.</l>
<l>Wait, what about the tour?</l>
<l>We just got here. I don’t wanna be
          disrespectful...</l>
<l>I’m serious. Later.</l>
<l>I’ve heard stories.</l>
<l>Oh, cool.</l>
<l>I hear that happens a lot.</l>
<l>--Owens won in front of Hitler.</l>
<l>Not really. That one always just
          stood out in my mind.</l>
<l>Yeah, tough break for your father
though.</l>
<l>She’s a Therapist right?</l>
<l>Like mother like daughter.</l>
<l>And you’re a surgeon?</l>
<l>That view.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Yeah?</l>
<l>I wasn’t gonna go there.</l>
<l>Hey. People need work.</l>
<l>My Dad was never really in the
          picture. My mom passed away when I
          was 11; She was hit by a car.</l>
<l>Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my
          cousins. We didn’t have a lot of
          money or anything, but she’s a
          good person; kept me off the
          streets. She gave me my first
          camera.</l>
<l>4 months? 5 months.</l>
<l>5? She’s right; I’m wrong.</l>
<l>I mean, we’ve been trying to take
          it slow but...</l>
<l>At the blood drive.</l>
<l>No. I’m quitting.</l>
<l>How?</l>
<l>Oh.</l>
<l> Wow. I don’t... Thank you. Um, I
          don’t know.</l>
<l>The get-together?</l>
<l>I must have forgot.</l>
<l>Sounds fun.</l>
<l>No, no... These are good. I wanna
hear this.</l>
<l>Whoa, what?</l>
<l>Ahhhh! You bit him?</l>
<l>Damn. That’s badass, Bae.</l>
<l>Ah, Orioles. My mom was from
          Baltimore so--.</l>
<l>You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too
          brutal for me. I’m a lover, not a
          fighter.</l>
<l>Not really. I did take Judo for
          after-school in 1st grade.</l>
<l>Cool... Thanks?</l>
<l>I’ve got a rule. I don’t play-
          fight with drunk dudes.</l>
<l>Yeah. Nerves got me I guess.</l>
<l>I still don’t know if this is
right for me.</l>
<l>I’m good. The dude was running out
          there. Scared me.</l>
<l>Nah, I’m good. It’ll keep me up.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>It’s perfect, thanks.</l>
<l>Yep.</l>
<l>So, how does this work? Are you
          going to swing a pocket watch in
          front of my face?</l>
<l>Heightened suggestibility. Okay,
          where do we start?</l>
<l>Yeah, my memory sucks.</l>
<l>I guess if it makes me quit...
          Wait... Has it started--?</l>
<l>I was home. I was watching TV.</l>
<l>Okay... Yeah, I found it.</l>
<l>I knew it. She was never late
          after work. When she didn’t come
          home, I just knew something was
          wrong.</l>
<l>I found it.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>I just sat there. Watching TV.</l>
<l>No.</l>
<l>I don’t know. I thought if I did,
          it would make it real.</l>
<l>I found it.</l>
<l>--Found it.</l>
<l>I don't want to.</l>
<l>Wait--.</l>
<l>No! NO!!! I’m done! Bring me back!
Please!!!!</l>
<l>Mrs. Armitage!!</l>
<l>Something’s down here...</l>
<l>Bring me back. Bring me back.
          Bring me back. Bring me back...</l>
<l> Bring me back. Bring me back.
          Bring me back.</l>
<l>No!</l>
<l>Damn.</l>
<l>What’s up?</l>
<l>They working you good out here,
huh?</l>
<l>Ha!</l>
<l>Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I
          never really got to meet you
          actually, up close. I’m Chris.</l>
<l>Yeah. That’s one way to put it.
          So, where you from originally?</l>
<l>Rose? Yeah, she is...</l>
<l>Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was
          pretty drunk.</l>
<l>I don’t remember much.</l>
<l>Hypnosis? No, I didn’t...</l>
<l>There’s another bird...</l>
<l>Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I
          think your mom hypnotised me last
          night.</l>
<l>I think I snuck out for a smoke,
          and she caught me and offered? I
          don’t know. I must have agreed to
          it ‘cause the thing just made me
          nauseous.</l>
<l>No, not good. I can barely
          remember any of it even happening;
          I don’t like that. Plus I had
          these fucked up dreams.</l>
<l>What did?</l>
<l>And, what’s the deal with the
help?</l>
<l>That, but also the lawn-mower guy
          creepin’ me the fuck out too.</l>
<l>It’s not what he says, it’s how he
          says it. You know?</l>
<l>Thanks. You too.</l>
<l>Once, actually; a few years ago. I
          wasn’t very good.</l>
<l>Oh? No kidding.</l>
<l>Me? I could barely hit the thing.</l>
<l>It’d be kind of a waste of time
          travel though.</l>
<l>Wow. Um..</l>
<l>Oh, will you now?</l>
<l>Right. I mean--.</l>
<l>I’m sorry. I’m going to get
          another drink.</l>
<l>It’s good to see another brother
around here.</l>
<l>Who do you know?</l>
<l>Chris. Rose’s boyfriend.</l>
<l>Sure.</l>
<l>What? Oh, I forgot.</l>
<l>Who?</l>
<l>I guess people only see what’s in
          front of them.</l>
<l>I mean...</l>
<l>Chris--.</l>
<l>Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson
          Galleries?</l>
<l>How do you do it?</l>
<l>Thank you. Yeah, I just like
          finding the beauty in abandoned
          things.</l>
<l>Damn.</l>
<l>Shit ain’t fair, man.</l>
<l>Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you.</l>
<l>Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That
          would be a game changer.</l>
<l>Not my game, what can I say.</l>
<l>Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin’
smack huh?</l>
<l>Boom!</l>
<l>Hold up. Here.</l>
<l>I’m gonna go to the bathroom.</l>
<l>The housekeeper unplugged my
          phone.</l>
<l>I’m trying to check in with Rod,
          and I got no juice.</l>
<l>Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she
          doesn’t like the fact that I’m
          with you.</l>
<l>What? It’s a thing.</l>
<l>Forget it. Nevermind.</l>
<l>You’re right. I’m being paranoid.
          I just need a minute and I’ll be
          down.</l>
<l>Bruh. What’s up?</l>
<l>Yeah...</l>
<l>They just got me over here meeting
          all the family friends. It’s like
          they never met a black dude that
          doesn’t work for them or some
          shit.</l>
<l>Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised
          last night...</l>
<l>Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose’s mom
          is a hypnotherapist--.</l>
<l>Right.</l>
<l> Yeah, I’m like 99% sure they’re
          not a kinky sex family, but--.</l>
<l>And thanks for that image, right
there.</l>
<l>It’s the black people out here
          that are the weirdest. The help.
          It’s like they’re possessed or...</l>
<l>Ha ha--.</l>
<l>What’s fucked up is: You’re the
          first line of defense against
          terrorism.</l>
<l>Oh, and the one other black guest
          is like the whitest-most dude at
          the party.</l>
<l>I mean Rod, if you could see what
          this dude is wearing.</l>
<l>Aiight. I’ll try.</l>
<l>Thanks Rod, bye.</l>
<l>Hi.</l>
<l>Oh, no. It’s cool. I was just
confused.</l>
<l>Yeah, I--.</l>
<l>Really, it’s okay. I didn’t mean
          to rat you out.</l>
<l>...get you in trouble.</l>
<l>Too many names to remember but...</l>
<l>Yeah, I don’t know, man.</l>
<l>That’s actually a great question.
          Logan! They were asking me about
          the African American experience.
          Maybe you could take this one.</l>
<l>Shit.</l>
<l>Hey, man, I’m sorry, I--.</l>
<l>Yeah. Why did he come at me like
that?</l>
<l>No, I’m sorry about the flash. I
didn’t know.</l>
<l>Yeah, you too.</l>
<l>My cousin is epileptic. That
          wasn’t a seizure.</l>
<l>Also, this is gonna sound weird,
          but when he got up in my face like
          that, I got the feeling like I
          knew that guy.</l>
<l>Let’s go back home tonight.</l>
<l>I’m just... Something doesn’t feel
right.</l>
<l>No. With this whole situation! I
          just... I can’t explain but I need
          you to trust me. Let’s just go. It
          doesn’t even have to be a big
          deal.</l>
<l>Baby, I--.</l>
<l>Late?</l>
<l>Oh.</l>
<l>I don’t know what to say.</l>
<l>I told you about the night my mom
          died. How I didn’t call 911;
          didn’t go out looking for her.</l>
<l>One hour went by, then two,
          three... I just sat there... I
          just watched TV.</l>
<l>I found out later she had survived
          the initial hit.</l>
<l>She laid there bleeding by the
          side of the road all night, cold
          and alone. And that’s how she died
          in the early morning... Cold and
          alone. And I was watching TV.</l>
<l>There was time. If someone was
          looking for her, there was time.
          But no one was looking.</l>
<l>Yeah... yeah. So, I’m not gonna
          leave here without you. I‘m not
          going to abandon you. Never.</l>
<l>Yeah?</l>
<l>I love you.</l>
<l>That was fast.</l>
<l>Dre?</l>
<l>Veronica from...</l>
<l>Yeah. That is him. But...</l>
<l>This is so fuckin’ crazy. He’s
          different now.</l>
<l>Different. Slower... I mean he was
          street; now he’s all like...
          white- seeming. Oh, plus he’s gay!</l>
<l>I’m telling you: He’s gay, I met
          his man. He’s--.</l>
<l>Um... Looking for my camera.</l>
<l>Where are the keys..? I gotta put
          our bags in the trunk.</l>
<l>Nah, I’ll do it.</l>
<l>Nothing.</l>
<l>I’m going to the car; see if we
          left the keys in there.</l>
<l>I’m good.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>No. Well, yeah... Um.</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Right now, it’s finding the keys.</l>
<l>Rose...</l>
<l>Rose, what is this shit?!</l>

          know me!!!! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!!!</l>

<l>Okay. Okay! What do you want? You

          you say, just answer me!</l>
<l>No-.</l>
<l>I need water.</l>
<l>I need to get outta here.</l>
<l>Where’s Rose?</l>
<l>Is this some kind of a game to
you?</l>
<l>Who the fuck are you people?</l>
<l>You hypnotize me? Break my will..?
          Make me a slave like the others?
