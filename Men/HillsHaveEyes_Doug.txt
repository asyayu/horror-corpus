<l>Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly
like normal people?</l>
<l>Please, your parents can't stand
me.</l>
<l>We could have taken them on a
cruise.</l>
<l>What's that supposed to mean?</l>
<l>It won't be in a shitty trailer
home-that's for sure.</l>
<l>Excuse me sir, do you have a phone
I can use? I can't get a signal
around here and...</l>
<l>This is why I don't go on vacation.
They're lost without me.</l>
<l>Who me? No way. I'm in
telecommunications.</l>
<l>Everybody's gotta have a cell
phone...</l>
<l>No kidding...
As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns--.</l>
<l>Let me pay, Bob.</l>
<l>That's not what I meant...</l>
<l>Honey!? We're leaving...
Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.</l>
<l>Honey? What are you doing?!</l>
<l>I tried for an hour but I couldn't
get it cold in here.</l>
<l>Well, at least we can breathe now.</l>
<l>How do you know all this stuff?</l>
<l>Fuck her!</l>
<l>Fuck him too. You want one?</l>
<l>Yeah right, if you start smoking
your sister would cut my nuts off.</l>
<l>Hey, I like seeing your parents...</l>
<l>...in pictures!</l>
<l>What the hell happened?! Where's
Catherine?</l>
<l>I knew this wasn't gonna be safe
for the baby.</l>
<l>Are you all right?</l>
<l>Your father wanted to see the
desert...</l>
<l>I hope he's enjoying himself.</l>
<l>So what's the damage, General?</l>
<l>Can we fix it?</l>
<l>I already tried. I'm not getting a
signal.</l>
<l>What are we going to do?</l>
<l>Walk?! But we're miles from ANYWHERE--.</l>
<l>Oh no! No thanks buddy...</l>
<l>I'll keep walking north. This
road's gotta lead somewhere.</l>
<l>What the fuck are you doing? Don't
point that thing at me.</l>
<l>Who else would it be?!</l>
<l>Hey girls!</l>
<l>Look what I found.</l>
<l>With all of this, we can find a way to fix the car, right Bobby?</l>
<l>I found this really huge crater at
the end of the road! I've never
seen anything like it! People must
use it as a dump site. It was full
of all this garbage...</l>
<l>Look at this, it's brand new!</l>
<l>No. The road just stops there. I
hope your dad has better luck.
Is there anything to eat? I'm
starving.</l>
<l>You want us to sleep on the floor?!</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Listen... I'm sure your dad will be
back soon. He's "Big Bob". It's
gonna take more than a few snakes
in the dark to stop him, right?</l>
<l>If he's not back by midnight, we'll
go get him. Deal?</l>
<l>Ow, Ow... Yeah right there.
Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed
New Mexico on foot.</l>
<l>Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!</l>
<l>Oh, so you want to play?</l>
<l>I love you too...</l>
<l>Damanit! What is it now?</l>
<l>Beauty what?</l>
<l>Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check
it out together. Lynn, stay right
here.</l>
<l>Brenda, stay with Catherine!</l>
<l>Take your mother away from here!</l>
<l>Where are you going? Bobby?</l>
<l>Come back here, Bobby!</l>
<l>No... No...</l>
<l>Not yet.</l>
<l>Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in
the kitchen.</l>
<l>Yes..</l>
<l>Do you need anything?</l>
<l>There's one here. Nice and warm.</l>
<l>DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?</l>
<l>You want to die, too?</l>
<l>Look! Look at what they did to your
mother. Look at what they did to
your sister.</l>
<l>You're not a fucking child,
alright? Think before you do
something stupid. You won't make it
three feet! We need a plan, OK? We
need to think...</l>
<l>STOP IT! SHUT UP! JUST SHUT YOUR
FUCKING MOUTH!</l>
<l>Get ready Bobby..</l>
<l>Beast!</l>
<l>WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS TO US?!</l>
<l>ANSWER ME! WHY US?!</l>
<l>How much ammo do you have left?</l>
<l>No, you stay here with your sister
and stay by the radio. Somebody's
bound to hear us.</l>
<l>The sun'll be up soon. One of them
is hurt, I'm going to follow his
trail through the hills.</l>
<l>No. You keep it in case they come
back.</l>
<l>Don't worry about me, I'll take
Beast.</l>
<l>Yes?</l>
<l>I'm going to find our baby my
love...I promise.</l>
<l>I told you to stop smoking.</l>
<l>Bobby? Bobby? You read me?</l>
<l>I followed the blood, I'm in front
of a mine!</l>
<l>I'm not sure if I'll get a signal
from inside. If you don't hear from
me in a half an hour, you're on
your own.</l>
<l>You ready big guy? I hope you're
not afraid of the dark.</l>
<l>Come on. You can't be serious.</l>
<l>Just stay calm, boy...</l>
<l>Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug... I
can't believe it! I found a street
and some houses. Maybe somebody
does live here...</l>
<l>Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby?</l>
<l>Find her, Beast, find Catherine...</l>
<l>You wait here Beast! Come on,
sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find
Catherine...</l>
<l>Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!
I'll be back...</l>
<l>Where's my baby! Where's
Catherine?!</l>
<l>What did you do with her?</l>
<l>What signs?!</l>
<l>What the hell are you saying?!</l>
<l>I don't know what you're talking
about. All I want is my daughter.
Please...</l>
<l>What do you want? Money? I can give
you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?</l>
<l>Where are the others? Where is my
baby?</l>
<l>What? What's so funny?</l>
<l>Please, I'm begging you... Don't
kill me...</l>
<l>Catherine?!</l>
<l>CATHERINE!</l>
<l>Catherine!</l>
<l>My baby... My little princess... It's
me, it's daddy...</l>
