<l>They're playin' well, Kev, they're
playin' awful damn well. Win this
one they could have a shot.</l>
<l>Hey Linda.</l>
<l>Fryeburg, yeah. Shit. Well, one
at a time, one at a time...</l>
<l>Thanks, Kev.</l>
<l>Scotty McLeod! You throw like you
drive, son, too damn fast!</l>
<l>Look alive, fellas! Deano, watch
the squeeze!</l>
<l>Rory, what in God -- ?</l>
<l>Rory, whoa, Rory, Rory, whoa, whoa,
whoa!</l>
<l>STOP I SAID!!</l>
<l>The hell you doing, Rore? Hunh?
Got a ball game going on here.
We're playing ball, you come out
here with a gun? The goddamn hell
you doing?</l>
<l>Lay it down, Rory, you're drunk.</l>
<l>Lay it down!</l>
<l>Don't do it, Rory! Don't you do
it!</l>
<l>He didn’t give me a choice.</l>
<l>You should be sleeping.</l>
<l>Peggy, I...</l>
<l>I knew what I was gonna say before
I got here...</l>
<l>I'm real sorry, Peg. I liked Rory,
I liked him a lot.</l>
<l>Pastor, Charlie...</l>
<l>Medical examiner still here?</l>
<l>Charlie, whatever the costs are for
the funeral, bill comes to me, all
right?</l>
<l>Just wanted to get his bloodalcohol,
put in my report.</l>
<l>Come again?</l>
<l>I heard what you said. Stacy,
that's not right, he was drunk.</l>
<l>Russ.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>So you all saw something last night
I sure wish you hadn't...</l>
<l>...Hard to make sense of it, even
for me. Talk to your teachers,
talk to me if you want...</l>
<l>...We don’t have all the answers,
but we’re here to help.</l>
<l>Yeah. Dad swore he wouldn't last a
month down there. Then he saw the
golf courses.</l>
<l>Hungry?</l>
<l>What do you want?</l>
<l>Sit.</l>
<l>Could drive you up to see your
parents this weekend, if you want.</l>
<l>Thought maybe the moon was full, I
don’t know, definitely some
weirdness going around. Medical
examiner said he found nothing in
Rory’s system.</l>
<l>Meaning, according to the state,
the man I shot was sober.</l>
<l>Saw him at lunch and he seemed
fine.</l>
<l>Looked him right in the eye. He
was under the influence of
something. If it wasn’t alcohol it
was something else.</l>
<l>Dutton...</l>
<l>I'm coming.</l>
<l>Farnums’, the whole place is going
up.</l>
<l>What happened, Bill?</l>
<l>Bill, what happened here tonight?</l>
<l>Was hoping to transfer him, we’re
not really equipped for this sort
of thing. Okay, two o'clock.</l>
<l>Looked at me last night like he
coulda slit my throat and barely
known the difference.</l>
<l>Same look Rory gave me. Same
goddamn look.</l>
<l>What're you lookin' for?</l>
<l>Yeah, do that.</l>
<l>Got us a pilot, where's the plane?</l>
<l>I know he's a lyin' bastard.</l>
<l>Travis.</l>
<l>Say that again you'll be the second
person I shot this week.</l>
<l>Something came real close to taking
a bath.</l>
<l>Know what that is?</l>
<l>Then don't touch it.</l>
<l>It was a big plane.</l>
<l>'Cause we're right on top of it.</l>
<l>Say, you folks missing a plane?</l>
<l>No? Well somebody oughta tell that
to the pilot in our morgue.
Military, yes, ma'am. Dutton. D-UT-
T-O-N. Yep, I'll be here.</l>
<l>Plane that size goes down and
there's nothing in the paper,
nothing on the news? Make any
sense to you?</l>
<l>Hopman Bog, what's that drain into?</l>
<l>Which drains into...?</l>
<l>Black Pond? Is that right?</l>
<l>Russ, where the hell you think we
get our water from?</l>
<l>Which way's the water flow through
town?</l>
<l>Drinking.</l>
<l>Whose house does it get to first?</l>
<l>Next house is Bill Farnum's. I
mean, am I talking nonsense here or
is it possible they reacted to
something they drank, something in
the water?</l>
<l>Farnum's are a mile out, might not
have made it this far yet. Tell
everybody don't drink it.</l>
<l>I’m shutting it down, Tom.</l>
<l>Either I'm losin' it completely or
I just saw a guy in a spacesuit out
by Hadley Road.</l>
<l>Did we or did we not request a
transfer to Wichita this morning?</l>
<l>Yup.</l>
<l>Even better.</l>
<l>You know what...</l>
<l>We're in trouble.</l>
<l>What'd you hear?</l>
<l>Lizzie, run down the station, tell
Russell what you just told me, tell
him I need him asap.</l>
<l>Charlie?</l>
<l>Charlie?</l>
<l>Charlie, if that's you, say
something!</l>
<l>Charlie?</l>
<l>Jim - ?!</l>
<l>The A & P has plenty of bottled.
Bruce’s agreed to sell it at cost
till we work out another source.
Thanks again, Bruce.</l>
<l>I know, Nathan. Russell’s on his
way to Wichita right now, see if we
can get some answers.</l>
<l>What - ?</l>
<l>Maybe you should go stay with your
parents for a while.</l>
<l>Look, this isn't --.</l>
<l>What? What was it?</l>
<l>Somebody there?!</l>
<l>What the fu--?! Get off her!!</l>
<l>What did we get exposed to?! What
was it?!</l>
<l>So they round us up with assault
rifles, what's that?</l>
<l>In plainspeak.</l>
<l>Hey Tom, how's Kentucky?</l>
<l>Wow, sounds like your civil rights
might have been violated, you
should look into that.</l>
<l>You ran. Town needed a leader.</l>
<l>It's not our town anymore.</l>
<l>Same ones who don’t know anything
about a dead pilot and aren’t
missing a plane.</l>
<l>now! Hey, do you hear me?!</l>
<l>Get away from her! She’s not sick,
she’s pregnant!</l>
<l>LEAVE HER ALONE!!</l>
<l>Judy...</l>
<l>Kevin! I gotta get outta here!</l>
<l>WHAT?!?!</l>
<l>They took Judy.</l>
<l>What do you want me to do, Ed?</l>
<l>Anybody heard what it is yet? What
they spilled?</l>
<l>What?</l>
<l>Let ‘em have it.</l>
<l>Judy's a fool's errand?</l>
<l>Tell you what, Kev. You don't ask
me why I can't leave without my
wife and I won't ask you why you
can.</l>
<l>Stop surprising me like that.</l>
<l>They let you guys out?</l>
<l>I’m going to get her.</l>
<l>You don't know that.</l>
<l>Russ, we got enough problems
without you inventing ‘em.</l>
<l>Who's the sheriff?</l>
<l>Who's the sheriff of Marsh County?</l>
<l>I am. Who's the deputy?</l>
<l>You are. Deputy does what the
sheriff tells him, that's the
balance of power. Now I'm telling
you you're not getting sick,
understand?</l>
<l>That’s the school! They’re
bailing! Come on!</l>
<l>You okay?</l>
<l>Where are you going?!</l>
<l>That truckstop where fifty hits the
county line, they're taking people
out of there, putting them on
buses.</l>
<l>Wichita maybe, wherever, some safe
zone.</l>
<l>My cruiser's back at the house.</l>
<l>I'm thinking the power line road.
It's crap, but we can drive it.</l>
<l>Exactly.</l>
<l>You’re not sick.</l>
<l>If you’re sick, I’m sick -- we
drank from the same tap -- and I’m
not sick. Not yet anyway. So
let’s keep walking.</l>
<l>It’s not human nature’s doing this,
it’s a chemical.</l>
<l>Shit! Get her out of there!</l>
<l>Down down down!</l>
<l>In there.</l>
<l>Shut her up!</l>
<l>Pray they don't do a headcount.</l>
<l>Aw Jesus...</l>
<l>What's your name?</l>
<l>From who?!</l>
<l>Billy, I want you to tell me what
exactly the fuck is going on down
here.</l>
<l>Nobody’s said anything about what
it was they spilled?</l>
<l>How’d it go?</l>
<l>How? The truckstop?</l>
<l>Cool it, Russ.</l>
<l>We're not staying here.</l>
<l>Yeah, we're gonna hold onto those,
Billy.</l>
<l>That’s why.</l>
<l>Let’s get to the house.</l>
<l>I told you why.</l>
<l>Judy, wait!</l>
<l>What are you doing?</l>
<l>Stop.</l>
<l>None of this matters. You know
that.</l>
<l>We'll have to take our chances on
the highway. Power lines will take
too long.</l>
<l>Stay with them, I'll be right back.</l>
<l>Yeah. How ‘bout you?</l>
<l>You don’t know that.</l>
<l>He saved my life, that’s what I
saw.</l>
<l>Goddammit.</l>
<l>I left the water at the house.</l>
<l>Fifteen miles.</l>
<l>I’d worry about her.</l>
<l>Hey Russ.</l>
<l>Russell!</l>
<l>Let’s get the car.</l>
<l>Can’t drink it anyway.</l>
<l>That your car out front?</l>
<l>Hey, is that your car out there?</l>
<l>Can we borrow the keys?</l>
<l>Shit, get back!</l>
<l>Russ, I called to ya, you kept
walking. We were gonna pick you up
down the road.</l>
<l>What would you recommend, dear?</l>
<l>We’re five miles the other way now.</l>
<l>What? Where?</l>
<l>Somebody turned it on!</l>
<l>Goddammit!</l>
<l>RUSSELL!!!</l>
<l>EVERYTHING’S FUCKING MOVING!!</l>
<l>Come on, come on, come on...</l>
<l>And you know why.</l>
<l>I’m feeling persuasive.</l>
<l>It'll drive on the rims.</l>
<l>Bastards.</l>
<l>Move!</l>
<l>Did you just block out the last
seventy-two hours of your life?
They're not even gonna stop.</l>
<l>Russ! Russ! Let me talk to him!</l>
<l>What did you people spill?</l>
<l>The guy standing between you and a
bullet.</l>
<l>What were we exposed to?</l>
<l>What’s he talking about?</l>
<l>Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
you guys engineered this crap?!
You got any idea what it does to
people?!</l>
<l>How about ‘sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town’?!</l>
<l>You guys are gonna let us die here
for one-in-a-million odds?</l>
<l>NOOO!!!</l>
<l>WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?! I SAID I
WANTED TO TALK TO HIM!!</l>
<l>I’ll get the guns from him.</l>
<l>He's a good kid, but I'll kill him
if I have to.</l>
<l>Thanks.</l>
<l>I'll carry 'em for a while. You've
been carrying 'em the whole time.</l>
<l>I got 'em.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Stop talking. Let him think about
what he's doing.</l>
<l>No. Give him a target he'll hit
it. Let me think a minute.</l>
<l>Fuck it, I'm gonna confront him.</l>
<l>We don't get to that truck stop
we're dead anyway.</l>
<l>I want to talk to you.</l>
<l>Just wanna talk.</l>
<l>Put the gun down.</l>
<l>Put it down.</l>
<l>I just want to talk to you.</l>
<l>Can we talk? Man to man?</l>
<l>Okay. Here's the deal --.</l>
<l>Yeah.</l>
<l>Ten fifteen pounds.</l>
<l>They'll see us.</l>
<l>Come on. We're there.</l>
<l>It was Grand Central last night.</l>
<l>In what...?</l>
<l>Nobody leaves.</l>
<l>We don't get outta here nobody's
ever gonna know what happened.</l>
<l>Whatever they want.</l>
<l>All these roads are gonna be
blocked.</l>
<l>Thirty miles to Wichita. On foot,
avoiding main roads, we’ll average
maybe three four miles an hour.
That gets us there by daybreak.</l>
<l>I don’t know. We gotta move.</l>
<l>Truck’s still there.</l>
<l>Fuck.</l>
<l>They’re coming.</l>
<l>Climb!</l>
<l>Lock 'em!</l>
<l>See if any of those work!</l>
<l>What are you doing?!</l>
<l>Hurry!</l>
<l>YEEEAH!</l>
<l>Perfect.</l>
<l>That's everything!</l>
<l>Anything?</l>
<l>Anything?!</l>
<l>Nothing?</l>
<l>WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!</l>
<l>GET DOWN!</l>
<l>Couple waters.</l>
<l>Bottled.</l>
